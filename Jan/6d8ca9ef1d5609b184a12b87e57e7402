Q: We are travelling from Miami to Cancun, Mexico, in July. Is it correct that SA nationals with a valid US visa don't have to get a Mexican visa? I've also read all foreign visitors must have a visitor's permit - can I get those before we leave to avoid queues at the airport in Mexico? - Estelle HoffmanYes, normally South African passport holders do require a visa to visit Mexico if you go there direct, but if you already have a valid visa for the US (or a Schengen), you will not need a Mexican visa. There is no other visitor's permit.For more information, phone the Mexican Embassy in Pretoria on 012-460-1004. Do you have a query for our travel expert?
