Q: I suffer from early ejaculation. My penis also does not get fully erect, there is a lack of feeling and I experience pain when I use the toilet. I have tried boosters, tea, pills and traditional medicines, but nothing works.A: Chronic pelvic pain and erectile dysfunction are some of the most common causes of sexual dysfunction. Your symptoms may seem unrelated, but they likely point to a nerve problem.Sex Talk: How can I put a stop to premature ejaculation?The affected nerve is the pudendal nerve. When functioning optimally, it ensures that sensation and motor functioning is maintained for the large area of the perineum, anus and rectum, penis and scrotum.The branches of this nerve could be affected to varying degrees. Sometimes there is no apparent explanation and diagnosis may be reached only after exclusion of other conditions like pinching or entrapment, trauma or inflammation.You may need to simultaneously consult a urologist, neurologist and a pain specialist. Although full recovery is not guaranteed, this multidisciplinary approach may give you the best chance of recovery.
