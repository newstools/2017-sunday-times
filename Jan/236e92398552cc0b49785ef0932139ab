On an appalling playing surface, Gyan headed home from Jordan Ayew's cross in the 21st minute to score his eighth goal at Afcon over six consecutive tournaments going back to 2008.With two victories from two matches in Group D, the Black Stars, runners-up in 2015, are certain of another appearance in the knockout stage of a tournament they have won four times. Mali have just a single point but are not out of the competition yet. Spurs draw; Rooney finally breaks recordThe state of the pitch meant the two teams were not allowed to use it for their pre-match warm-ups, instead being forced to use an indoor facility. The surface did not lend itself to a flowing game of football, but at least the sizeable Malian community in this Gabonese port city made for a raucous atmosphere. Sadly for them, Ghana initially coped better on the pitch and they should have been in front in the 17th minute.Christian Atsu, the standout performer at the last Afcon in Equatorial Guinea, did brilliantly on the right before delivering a low ball to the near post which Ayew would surely have converted. However, Andre Ayew took the ball off the feet of his younger brother, Jordan, and stabbed a shot wide.Nevertheless, Avram Grant's men were ahead before the midway point in the first period as Jordan crossed from the right and captain Gyan rose unmarked to head past Oumar Sissoko in the Mali goal.The Black Stars celebrated by running across to the bench and holding up T-shirts with a message of support for leftback Abdul Rahman Baba, whose tournament was ended by a serious knee injury in the opening win against Uganda.Sissoko did well to save a Jordan cross-cum-shot that bounced awkwardly in front of him and Mali then came out with greater purpose after the break.Just as in their opening goalless draw with Egypt, the introduction of exciting young Lille midfielder Yves Bissouma gave them an extra impetus.Despite that, they couldn't find an equalising goal, with Moussa Marega heading straight at Razak Brimah from a Bakary Sako cross and defender Salif Coulibaly hooking a shot just wide after Ghana had struggled to clear their lines.Ghana were hanging on right until the end, with goalkeeper Brimah making a fine reaction save to deny substitute Kalifa Coulibaly from point-blank range in the 90th minute and then beating away a Sako volley in injury time.
