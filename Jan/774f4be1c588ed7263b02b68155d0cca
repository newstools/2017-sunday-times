Healthy options include low-salt canned vegetables and fruit canned in their own juice or in water.Canned pilchards, sardines and tuna are affordable and are excellent sources of omega 3 and calcium, says University of Stellenbosch dietician Irene Labuschagne.Canned or dried beans, lentils and peas are healthy sources of affordable protein.Also, using canned vegetables and beans in soups and stews provides a similar nutritional value as the fresh ingredients would provide, sometimes at a lower price and with added convenience.Because canned foods are already cooked, they require minimal further cooking time.TIP: Check the nutrition facts on canned, dried, and frozen items. Look for products that are low in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.
