It's off to the races! Get ready to show off your glam side at the Sun Met, which is taking place on Saturday, January 28, at Kenilworth Racecourse in Cape Town. This year's theme is 'decades of glamour', so you can take wardrobe cues from your favourite era in the last eight decades of fashion. From 1920s vintage to 2000s modern, creative possibilities abound, so deciding what to wear could be a challenge.To ensure you don't stumble out of the starting gates in the fashion stakes, we asked designer Malcolm Kluk from KLUK CGDT to share some advice on what to wear.Hatiquette: Dos & don'ts of donning a hat in public Be inspired by the theme. Pick a decade in fashion that you love, be inspired by the details and the decadence of the time and use it to build your contemporary Met look. Think, drop-waist flapper dresses from the '20s, floral tea dresses from the '30s or fitted suits from the '40s . Stay cool. The Met calls for a knee-length cocktail dress; it's appropriate for a hot summer's day and will give you an air of sophistication. Style it up: A horse race is your chance to show off your true style and flaunt your favourite accessories. Complete your look with a hat and sunglasses. Rely on fancy dress props. Avoid being a fashion victim by leaving the fancy dress props at home. Consider your look as a homage to a style of the past by giving it a modern twist, without the unnecessary feathers and sequins. Wear the wrong shoes. Try block heels or flatforms, they re not only trendy and comfortable, but grass-friendly.
