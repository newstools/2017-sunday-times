Bully's sex clip goes viral on social mediaDaley told the Sun newspaper: "This will absolutely never happen again now that we're getting married. The date is set, and we're raring and ready to go for that wedding now." The Olympic bronze medallist said his relationship with Black was stronger than ever."It was the distance. It's not like I actually met up with anyone. I'm 22 years old, and if you talk to someone through social media it is what it is. It was nothing more than that. We never physically met."But in the modern world this is what can happen - things are more accessible online, and distributed, and they spread like wildfire," said Daley.He said that distance had made the couple realise "how fond" they were of each other."'Lance and I had a period of time apart, and then coming back together and realising we're meant for each other ..."Lance and I have such a strong connection that again our honesty and openness is so important."
