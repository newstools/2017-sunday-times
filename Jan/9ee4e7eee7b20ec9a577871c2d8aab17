The project is being pushed by the council on defence on the eve of a long-awaited R10-billion navy procurement package, dubbed Project Biro and Hotel.It involves reserving a large share of the construction work for state arms manufacturer Denel and its Chinese joint venture partner, which have earmarked Simon's Town dockyard as a preferred construction site.The Defence Department and Denel are tight-lipped , but several independent sources involved confirmed that: Workers fear China designs on navy docks Shipbuilding heavyweights Southern African Shipyards and Damen have been notified of preferred bidder status to build six patrol vessels and a hydrographic survey vessel, but have been told their involvement depends on including Denel and Chinese partner Poly Technologies; The shipbuilders have been told the deal might be scrapped if they refuse to include Denel and Poly despite a work-share arrangement not being part of the tender - which would appear to be procedurally irregular; The matter has prompted a standoff within the military, with the navy opposed and the chief of the defence force reportedly in favour. Urgent talks have failed to resolve the issue. Key stakeholders are due to meet on Tuesday; and Although naval chiefs are keen on the vessels, they are opposed to Chinese involvement because the dockyard is used mostly for maintenanceSources said no reason was given for the inclusion of Denel and Poly other than that the move would facilitate an investment in the dockyard."Armscor [the state arms procurement agency] has indicated that the inclusion of Denel/Poly is a voluntary process but if no agreement can be reached with Denel then the [Biro and Hotel] project will be cancelled," said one source."The bidders are in discussion with Denel/Poly to see how they can include them."Meanwhile, Cape Town civic officials are flummoxed by the shipbuilding plan, claiming it would be opposed by residents of Simon's Town, historically a tourist suburb near Cape Point.In a statement issued during last year's Africa Aerospace &amp; Defence conference at Air Force Base Waterkloof, Denel said its memorandum of understanding with Poly Technologies involved "collaboration" in the maritime sector."The agreement will cover areas such as ship repairs, shipbuilding, naval systems and marine services," Denel said.According to the memo, Poly agreed to invest up to R800-million in the dockyard if Denel secured a share of the deal.Shipbuilding stakeholders questioned the rationale for building in Simon's Town rather than established shipbuilding hubs in Saldanha, Durban, or Paarden Island, Cape Town.Poly's move forms part of Beijing's efforts to extend its global footprint. It has proposed building a military base in Walvis Bay, Namibia.</img>The SAS Amatola is ready to sail after a R400-million overhaul.

Image: Supplied Reports in 2008 linked Poly Technologies to a shipment of arms to Zimbabwe .Biro and Hotel bidders declined to comment this week.Neither Poly Technologies nor Denel responded to e-mailed questions.Armscor, which issued the original tender, insisted the construction site of the vessels would be "determined by the successful bidders".It added: "Armscor is busy with a multi-source tender and will only disclose information once the procurement process is completed."An "official declaration" of the preferred bidder would be made before the end of the financial year.David Erickson, chairman of the Simon's Town Historical Society, said the proposed dockyard development had been reported to the South African Heritage Resources Agency. Parts of the dockyard date back to 1795. Defects sink Mendi 100 years on The navy frigate that cost more than Nkandla to refit will set sail this week after a R400-million overhaul.The SAS Amatola is due in Portsmouth in the UK next month for the centenary of the World War 1 sinking of the SS Mendi, a troopship that went down with black South African soldiers on board. Over 600 drowned.The Mendi was on its way to France when another ship collided with it on February 21 1917. It sank in little more than 20 minutes.Its namesake, the frigate SAS Mendi, will miss the commemoration because it has been docked for years due to major engine problems.The Amatola is the only South African frigate capable of making the voyage .The navy said it was unfortunate that the SAS Mendi was unavailable."It would have been an ideal opportunity to send the SAS Mendi but unfortunately she is not in the [operational] cycle at the moment," Amatola task force commander Captain Mike Boucher said on Friday.However, the commander of the Amatola, Captain Francois Roux, said the Amatola is a worthy replacement with an enthusiastic 177-strong crew."Unlike Nkandla, the Amatola has no chicken run, which is a pity since the crew is expected to consume about 37,000 eggs during the three-month deployment. The voyage will include stopovers in Germany, Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, Angola and Namibia.
