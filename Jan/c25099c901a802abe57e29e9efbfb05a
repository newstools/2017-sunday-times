But, according to Richard Andrews, the MD of Inspiration Office, an office and furniture consultancy, "even small tweaks can make the workplace a more comfortable and pleasant experience".He has the following advice:1) Avoid using an exercise ball as an office chair. Andrews describes them as "uncomfortable and impractical" and suggests using a good, old-fashioned "comfortable, ergonomic chair";2) Spending the day staring at a computer screen can be a serious pain - in the neck and eyes. Andrews suggests raising your screen so your eyes are looking directly at it when you are sitting normally. "Most people tend to look down at their screens, placing particular strain on the neck," he says;3) Give your hands and wrists a break, because using a keyboard for long periods puts an unnatural strain on your wrists;4) Try to change position during the day - vary between sitting and standing as much as you can;5) A short walk during your lunch break is a good way to add exercise to your day; and6) Long hours under artificial light is not good for your mood. Try to add some sunlight by, for example, simply walking through a sunny area a few times a day.
