In 2011 I lost everything I had after two franchises I owned closed down. With the passion I have for business and food I was able to see this gap in the market and turn my life around through it. Emile started creating different types and flavours of gourmet popcorn and could often be seen selling his goods at Market on Main Neighbourgoods Market 1Fox and the Fourways Farmers Market before finally opening his own store at Montecasino. I currently employ 15 people permanently and I hope to create around 50 new jobs in the next 12 months. Maverick and Jane was founded by Rayhaan Jhetam a CA who brought the idea of designer popcorn to South Africa after six years in the United Arab Emirates where he served in positions at KPMG and Al Hilal Bank. He told the Financial Mail last year: "I really wanted to come back to SA with a clear agenda and commitment there is so much work to be done here in terms of unemployment education and social welfare. I thought no matter how small I could make a difference from an SME perspective."</img>Emilio s Gourmet Popcorn in Montecasino, Joburg.
