Researchers at University College London and the University of Edinburgh reviewed the findings of 16 studies involving 163,000 people to determine what affect feeling worried and withdrawn has on health. Overall, people who were most distressed by their diagnosis were 32% more likely to die from their cancer.For individual cancers, the relationship were even more stark. People suffering from leukaemia were almost four times more likely to die if they were anxious or depressed, while those with prostate, pancreatic or oesophageal cancer were more than twice as likely not to survive. Fiber-rich diet could cut colorectal cancer risk: study Dr David Batty of UCL, the report's lead author, said: "Results show that, compared with the least distressed group, high distress group death rates were consistently higher for bowel, prostate, pancreatic, oesophageal cancer and leukaemia.Researchers monitored participants for an average of nine-and-a-half years and tracked their mental state. During the study more than 4,000 died of cancer.Those who died in the first five years were excluded in case undiagnosed cancer was driving their depression and anxiety. Researchers also adjusted for age, sex, education, socioeconomic status, body mass index, smoking and alcohol intake; the effect remained unchanged.Researchers speculate that chronic stress impeded immune cell function and allowed tumours to get a foothold and grow. The research was published in the British Medical Journal. - The Daily Telegraph This article was originally published in The Times
