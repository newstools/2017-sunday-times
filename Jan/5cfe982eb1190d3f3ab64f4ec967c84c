White, president of the popular UFC mixed martial arts brand in which Ireland's McGregor stars, seemed to indicate in his comments on a Fox radio broadcast that the two would meet in a boxing ring, not the UFC octagon.In addition to $25-million apiece, White said each fighter would get a cut of pay-per-view proceeds."If they're going to box, Floyd looks at this as an easy boxing match for him," he said. "Conor McGregor is his money fight. Tell you what, Floyd, here's a real offer - and I'm the guy who can make the offer - we'll pay you $25-million and Conor $25-million."White scoffed at Mayweather's claim this week that he'd offered McGregor $15-million to climb into the ring with him.Mayweather, who retired in 2015 with a perfect 49-0 record, told ESPN's First Take programme that a McGregor bout was the only thing that could tempt him to end his exile from the ring.Mayweather said he had talked to McGregor's representatives. "They know what my number is."My number is a guaranteed $100-million," he said, adding that he considered himself the "A-side" of the promotion."To think that you're the 'A' side... how are you the 'A' side?" White asked."He's claiming he's made offers. He hasn't made offers to anybody. I just made a real offer. McGregor will fight anybody, anywhere, anytime, and there is a line of guys he'll fight who'll do more than one million pay-per-view buys."McGregor became the first man to simultaneously hold UFC titles in two weight divisions when he beat Eddie Alvarez in New York on November 12.At the end of November, he was issued a boxing licence in the state of California in a development that fuelled speculation about a showdown between him and Mayweather.
