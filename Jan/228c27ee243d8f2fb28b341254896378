The woman - who by law may not be named - is claiming their antenuptial contract is invalid because they entered into a customary marriage, which started at Nkandla, before their civil marriage.Should the judge agree with her claim, she will get half of her husband's substantial estate, which is believed to include a private jet, various high-end properties, interests in eight companies and luxury vehicles including a Porsche 911 Turbo, a Range Rover, a Ferrari and two Mercedes-Benzes."No antenuptial contract was entered into between the parties prior to the conclusion of the customary marriage and, accordingly, in terms of the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act [it] is a marriage in community of property and of profit and loss," Zuma's daughter said in an amendment filed in the High Court in Johannesburg.</img>One of the assets in contention in the divorce is a R70,000 Breitling watch.

But in November she was granted an interim maintenance order of R168,000 a month for herself and their children.In her latest filing, Zuma's daughter said she and her husband agreed in 2010 to wed in a customary marriage. This was followed by a visit by the groom and his family to Nkandla for lobola negotiations, which were attended, among others, by Zuma, as the bride's father.In December that year the lobola, 16 cattle, were delivered to Nkandla. This was followed by the customary exchange of gifts between the families and the slaughter of a cow. Two months later the bride was delivered to the groom's home in the Eastern Cape.The couple then wed again in a lavish Parisian-themed ceremony that was described as South Africa's wedding of the year. However, the fairytale fell apart early in 2014 when the husband moved out of the matrimonial home.According to Zuma's daughter, the breakdown of the marriage was due to her husband's numerous "adulterous relationships with other women".In her papers the wife detailed how her husband had many cellphones and sim cards and sent and received "various intimate messages from other women".She said he had fathered a child with another woman and that she and the other woman were pregnant at the same time.The husband has denied this, saying the cause of the strains in the relationship was his decision to buy a home for another woman - the mother of his two children out of wedlock - as well as his wife's refusal to accept these children from a previous relationship.</img>Other cars used by the husband include two Mercs.

"We will obviously be denying. The intention of the parties before they even went through the customary processes was at all times to enter into an antenuptial contract," he said.</img>The couple stayed in five-star hotels in Spain.
