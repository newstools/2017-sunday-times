But the Labour Court in Johannesburg refused to reinstate Philemon Mathebula as head of the agriculture department in Mpumalanga, saying he was not "untainted"."It is difficult to see how the trust relationship ... could persist," Judge Robert Lagrange said on Thursday. Damelin sales drive unacceptable, says judgeEvidence before the court "gives rise to a serious sense of disquiet about his conduct as an accounting officer", said Lagrange, awarding Mathebula six months' pay as compensation for unfair dismissal.Lagrange overruled the bargaining council arbitrator who threw out Mathebula's appeal against dismissal, saying he had erred in allowing a charge brought under section 42 of the Public Finance Management Act to be "materially extended to embrace misconduct under section 38".The judge said: "Under that provision there was a much stronger case for him to answer." Section 42 relates to unauthorised transfers of assets between provincial entities, while section 38 deals with wasteful spending.The misconduct with which Mathebula was charged related to grants made between 2006 and 2008 when he was acting head of Mpumalanga's department of agriculture, rural development and land administration.The biggest beneficiary of grants cited by the province was the Mpumalanga Agricultural Development Agency, which received R70-million.Witnesses for the province said the grants were made to projects that were not functioning, without tender processes or supporting documents, and without ensuring that the use of the funds would be monitored and reported on.
