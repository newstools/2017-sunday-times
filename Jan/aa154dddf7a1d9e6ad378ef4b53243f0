Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande announced this week that the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) will provide student loans and bursaries worth R15.2-billion this year - a R1.2-billion increase from last year.But "fallists" demanding fee-free education have vowed to return to the picket lines.One #FeesMustFall leader, University of Johannesburg student Funzani Mutsila, said protests were "inevitable"."NSFAS is not the free education we have been calling for," said Mutsila. Private universities ready to step into breach"Essentially NSFAS puts you in debt. We feel undermined by the minister. We want free decolonised education now. As long as that is not on the table, we don't recognise anything else that the minister offers."Ntokozo Qwabe, a student at the University of Cape Town and a vocal #FeesMustFall leader, said the financial aid scheme was nothing more than a payment deferral system."It stops us from getting credit. I cannot start my own business while owing NSFAS."If there is no responsive and accountable action from government, then we are going to see a crisis. The struggle definitely continues and we stand resolute on that," Qwabe said.Another #FeesMustFall leader, University of KwaZulu-Natal student Nompilo Mkhize, said: "Our focus right now is to get as many students registered and ensure that they find residences. Then we will know from there what action to take."Nzimande said the government would pay the annual fee hike for all qualifying registered students whose families had an income below R600,000.A new funding model aimed at the "missing middle" - students too rich for financial aid scheme support but too poor to afford study - would be piloted at six universities and one technical and vocational training college.Meanwhile, the protesting students have found an ally in the National Union of Metalworkers, which threw its weight behind the campaign for free education during its 10th national congress last month.Numsa general secretary Irvin Jim told the Sunday Times: "As you know that workers must be at work during the day and student protests take place during normal working hours, it means that we might have to consider days where we stand in solidarity with the students.</img>Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande.
