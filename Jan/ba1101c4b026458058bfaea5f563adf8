Now she's the designer behind our go-to local brand for workwear, Somerset Jane.She tells us more about her favourite things. I would describe my design aesthetic as different each season, yet always in classic taste (Somerset Jane design pictured above). Right now, my favourite designer is Kym Ellery (design pictured above). The label for me is modern and minimal but has a bohemian spirit. The balance is brilliant and the bravery of proportions is something that scares and inspires me all at once. Up-and-coming SA designers whose labels you need to know about I love pants in all shapes and sizes: high waist, drop crotch, flared leg and cigarette. If I am going to spend money on something, it's pants. And if I'm going to start a collection, I start with designing pants. The right pair can just make your day. These pants are by Paper Dolls, available for R599 from Spree. The beauty products I swear by include Lasting Finish Lip Colour by Kate Moss for Rimmel in colour 01 (R100), it's my all-time favourite red. I also love Revlon Colorstay nail colour and top coat. If, like me, you do your own nails, this polish really lasts the longest. My favourite scent is Alien by Thierry Mugler (eau de parfum, R1,115 for 60ml, non-refillable). I am currently reading Vivienne Westwood by Ian Kelly. My favourite city is Joburg. Living and working as a designer doesn't leave much of a budget for travelling. I have been to Paris and seen a little of the US, however I really love it right here at home. I love that I grew up in Joburg, with family in both Cape Town and Durban. I have a familiarity with all three places and love them equally. I'll always state a strong case for comfort and home and all the beauty in that.
