Kim Lombard, a member of the South African Reward Association and the compensation, benefits and rewards manager at Danone, says any big change must be made "with finesse".She suggests avoiding snap decisions that you may regret. "Take the move one step at a time to ensure there is a clear understanding of the current reward reality so that any negotiations are done from an informed position and in line with the market. 3 ways to stay off the qualification fraudsters database"Reward is not exclusively about the money; while this is important, it is sometimes the intangible that makes a career choice a happy one," says Lombard.She has the following advice: Make sure you know exactly what you earn, including company contributions to retirement and medical aid and any other perks as well as potential incentive earnings. "Do the same for the non-financial aspects which are non-negotiable to you, such as a collaborative boss or ... healthy food access. Uncover what is of value personally within the company and what it would cost to lose it," she says; Get a sense of what is on offer. Use the information you have to compare other offers with your present position; and Pay attention to the synergy between the company and your values. "A culture fit is a more reliable determinant of success and happiness than the package on offer. And there is the need to negotiate a package in a way that shows a clear understanding of the current reward package along with value and market worth."
