England, South Africa, New Zealand and surprise package Canada all topped their pools with three wins from three matches to cruise into the quarterfinals. But it was the competition-leading Blitzboks who caught the eye, holding Australia and Japan scoreless before demolishing Fiji 31-12. Tough sevens pool for the Blitzboks in Wellingtom They raced to a 17-0 lead but Fiji narrowed it to 17-12 before the South Africans stepped up a gear and the reigning series champions and Olympic gold medallists had no answer."We came out and laid a solid foundation, then really built on that," captain Philip Snyman said. "Fiji ran us close towards the end but luckily the guys came through." Canada provided the major upsets of the day, defeating Wales (28-2), Scotland (28-19) and Russia (29-0). Scotland still qualified for the quarters as runners-up in their group, as did Argentina, Fiji and France. Local interest was on the Pool C grudge match between New Zealand - who have won the Wellington tournament for the past three years - and Tietjens' Samoa. Tietjens coached New Zealand for 22 years, guiding them to 12 Sevens World Series titles, four Commonwealth gold medals and two Sevens World Cup crowns. New Zealand scored in the first 90 seconds and went on to record a comprehensive 33-7 win. AFP
