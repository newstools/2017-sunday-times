"Women, after having had their children, just want perkier and shapelier rather than overtly large breasts," said Dr Chetan Patel, a Sandton plastic surgeon.A Cape Town counterpart, Dr Dirk Lazarus, said while "bigger butts are increasing in popularity, patients are less frequently wanting to go as big as previously"."More modest and natural results are now seen as desirable," said Lazarus.The procedure involves a full liposuction to obtain fat from the patient's body that is then recycled into her buttocks .Recovery is about three weeks and the cost is R100,000, said Lazarus. Age of clean living - and flaunting it to the world He said breast augmentation, which costs about R56,000, was still popular."The trend is for smaller, more natural-looking results than previously."When it comes to breasts, Patel said in South Africa "we have always been more in favour of the natural look"."It's more about achieving a better shape than a number on a garment."Some in the local celebrity set - with their pert posteriors and perfect bosoms - have turned up their noses at going the plastic-surgery route to achieve the body beautiful.They would rather remain natural.But curvy television personality Ntando Duma decided to test the waters as a joke after her DJ boyfriend Junior De Rocka made some booty comments on air.This week the Rhythm City star posted a digitally manipulated image of herself with a generous bottom to Instagram."I heard my boyfriend talking about code 14 girls [girls with big bums] on radio the other day and I prayed to God and said, 'Please give me a bum, God.'"My boyfriend will end up running away from my flat ass or 'vasplank'. And guess what? He listened! Thank you!" she posted in jest.Duma told the Sunday Times that she would never consider surgery to enhance her behind and felt no pressure to become bootylicious."I'm very much comfortable with my body and I'd never change it for anything. I say each to his own. You can never judge someone else on how they choose to boost their self-esteem "If you follow me on social media you'd know how much I love sharing my humour with the world. I'm someone who always has fun and that post was one of those crazy, random posts."She explained the dig at "code 14 girls" emanated from Soweto rapper MaEzee's new single, which references "girls with big bums".In the song, the rapper uses code 14 - which is the licence obtained by truckers who drive huge 18-wheel vehicles - to refer to a woman's large bottom.Bongekile Simelane, also known as Babes Wodumo, wouldn't dream of touching her perfect body.But the singer, best known for her hit song Wololo, believes women should be free to make their own choices."Anyone and everyone including women are free to do as they wish, if that is what they desire to do," said Simelane, who keeps in shape through vigorous dance routines.</img> The bottom line is no longer necessarily the wild curves of Nikki Minaj.

You can never judge someone else on how they choose to boost their self-esteem. Image and aesthetics are constantly evolving and unfortunately it's always about trends and what's the hottest thing at the moment," she said.Mbatha said South African women were no longer trying to look like celebrities but rather a "better version of themselves".Durban public relations graduate Minhle Dladla has considered butt implants."I won't lie, I have considered getting butt implants and my reasons are that men love a women with a 'package' to hold and grab."In today's society, African women are expected to have a thin waist and big bum and if you don't have any of the above you are not considered 'beautiful or pretty enough'," Dladla said.The secret surgery guru is tight-lipped about client list"I think I'd also get it for my own self-confidence. We all know when you look good you feel good and if a rounder and firmer bum will do that, then why not?"Johannesburg counselling psychologist Dr Ingrid Artus said career progression, self-esteem, popularity and "subcultures where personal value is mainly placed on physical appearance" influence women to surgically alter their appearance."Aesthetic cosmetic surgery can have positive or negative mental-health effects. Those who are satisfied with the outcome or who receive validation and praise from others may feel an increased level of self-confidence and enjoyment of life."There is, however, a risk that mental health can deteriorate if the results are perceived as unsatisfactory or when the expected life changes did not occur."Adjustment difficulties, depression, anger, anxiety, increase in alcohol consumption and eating disorders may occur after surgery, especially when the patient sets unrealistic expectations of the outcome."govendersu@sundaytimes.co.za
