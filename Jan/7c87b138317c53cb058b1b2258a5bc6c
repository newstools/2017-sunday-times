 Dolce &amp; Gabbana Velvet Pure, R3,505 for 50mlLight and earthy without being too sweet or feminine. The mixture of floral notes - galbanum, jasmine, cistus labdanum and fig leaves - is cleverly balanced with dry, woody base notes of orris root and Haitian vetiver. Carolina Herrera CH Confidential Burning Rose, R3,350 for 100mlA great one for those who enjoy a slightly more intense scent; it's warm, floral and spicy with a unique pairing of black pepper, rose and patchouli. Chanel Boy eau de parfum, R3,150 for 75mlA well-balanced unisex fragrance, Boy has a light, sharp and zesty opening of grapefruit and lemon that gives it a perfect pick-me-up quality before it settles into its heavier woody base of sandalwood, musk and moss.
