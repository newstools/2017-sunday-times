Inauguration day will be Melania's first chance to show off her take on First Lady style.Reports suggest that Melania has chosen all-American legend Ralph Lauren to create both the daytime and evening looks on her big day tomorrow. Lauren is said to be designing looks for other members of the Trump family too.First lady Melania Trump faces the political fashion policeThe fact that Ralph Lauren became deeply linked to the Hillary Clinton campaign would make the choice surprising. The designer created a highly meaningful series of pantsuits for key moments in the Democratic candidate's race in red, white and blue. When the white was worn as Clinton's nomination was officially confirmed, it was seen as a nod to the plight of the suffragettes. When the red appeared at the first debate, it evoked Clinton's strength and determination.Yet the choice of Lauren is not surprising because there is probably no living and working designer with "Americanism" running so resolutely through his veins. Lauren grew up in the Bronx, New York, and has created a multibillion dollar business off his clean-cut, preppy and athletic signature look which spans multiple fashion lines, homeware and accessories. The Lauren family are akin to aristocracy in the US - Lauren's son is married to Lauren Bush, granddaughter of the former president.Melania Trump also picked Ralph Lauren designs during the election campaign. She opted for a black jumpsuit for the third debate and on the night that her husband won she wore a white jumpsuit which she'd bought off the rack to accompany him on stage following his victory speech.Some members of the fashion industry have boycotted the Trumps. Marc Jacobs and Tom Ford have declared that they are not interested in dressing the incoming First Lady and they have been joined by numerous other names. - The Daily Telegraph This article was originally published in The Times.
