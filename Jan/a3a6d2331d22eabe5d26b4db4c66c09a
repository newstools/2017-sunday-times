Q: My vagina itches and the doctor said it's vaginal yeast. He gave me some cream but it seems to go away only to come back. How can I permanently resolve this problem?A: Thrush is usually caused by the yeast fungus Candida albicans, which lives harmlessly on the skin and in the mouth, gut and vagina. Normally a balance is maintained by a well-functioning immune system that keeps the yeast under control.Sex Talk: Why do I feel nothing during sex?An imbalance may be caused by many factors: Being pregnant; Wearing tight clothing (such as tight jeans) or synthetic clothing such as nylon underwear regularly; Taking antibiotics; Having chemotherapy; Having uncontrolled diabetes, HIV or other illnesses that affect your immune system and Using products that may cause irritation of the vagina, such as vaginal deodorants or perfumed bubble bath or douches. Thrush is not sexually transmitted, but it can start soon after and be worsened by sex.Women are more susceptible to thrush and itching is a symptom experienced by many. Other symptoms around the vagina and vulva may include redness, a white discharge that may be creamy and thick in consistency. There may be pain when passing urine and when having sex. If you have completed a course of treatment and you still have thrush, please consult your doctor for a vaginal swab.
