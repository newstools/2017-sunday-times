Victory with Zambia in 2012 and Ivory Coast two years ago is a unique achievement and a third title with Morocco in Gabon would make him the first man to win a continental championship with three different countries.Morocco take on Egypt in Port-Gentil in the quarterfinals today after eliminating holders Ivory Coast in their last group match on Tuesday in a match that brought the 48-year-old much satisfaction."I've been waiting for this moment to prove what I can do," he told reporters, aiming a dig at the Ivorian press who had declared him initially unfit to coach their team two years ago but then celebrated him when they won the 2015 Nations Cup.2017 African Nations Cup throws up some intriguing ties"There are people who told me that I was unworthy to coach."Then three weeks later, the same people were dancing on the tables. You change your coat every time," he added.Not shy of confrontation, Renard is an angry presence as he patrols the touchline during matches, barking orders and chastising players. But off the field he radiates charm as he tries to keep a lid on expectations."I think that when you win as we did against the Ivorians, you must always remain realistic," he said."The knockout stages are a new competition altogether where you need a winning mindset. There are better teams than us in this cup, but we have a chance to prove ourselves when we are confronted with them."Renard's film star good looks, lucky white shirt and booming voice pick him out from the crowd of coaches at the tournament, but it is the pace of his ascent to the top of the game that is most remarkable.A lower league professional in France who ran an office- cleaning business after retiring, he decided to become a coach and landed the job as Claude le Roy's assistant.That was ahead of the tournament in Ghana in 2008. Less than a decade later, he is the leading coach in African football and just three wins away from a legacy-making achievement.When Al-Ahli's Asamoah Gyan limped off the pitch during Ghana's narrow defeat to Egypt on Wednesday, Ghana's Afcon campaign turned gloomier.Gyan, the Black Stars' leader of the line for the best part of a decade, has a groin problem and his availability, or otherwise, for today's quarterfinal will have a bearing on morale, the national team's website reported.Losing top spot in the group to the Egyptians also means that Ghana take on DR Congo in the other quarterfinal.Gyan will feel as frustrated as anybody if he misses out.Five times a semifinalist at Afcon, and his country's all-time leading scorer in the tournament, he has two runners-up medals and a bronze medal but as yet no first prize. Record-winners Egypt emerge from slow start as Africa Cup of Nations contendersGhana would be forgiven for thinking that this should be their year, given that so many heavyweight teams have fallen before the last-eight stage, but they need vigilance, not least of Congo striker Junior Kabananga, the top scorer at Afcon with three goals.The renaissance continues. Egypt, with six Afcon trophies to their name, three of them this century, have been the grand absentees from the last tournaments.But fears of rustiness or low self-esteem as they returned to a finals for the first time since 2012 can be set aside now."We intend to go far," manager Hector Cuper said after the 1-0 win over Ghana that secured top place in Group D.A couple of smart saves in that fixture from goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary means Cuper can rest assured that the injury to Ahmed El-Shenawy, first-choice with the gloves at the outset of the tournament, is not a grave setback.The romantic storyline would have 44-year-old El-Hadary picking up his fifth Afcon winners medal a week from today.
