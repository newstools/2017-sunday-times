These are the first words uttered on the new Netflix show Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. And narrator Patrick Warburton is not wrong.Tune in or turn off: which series are worth watching?Three children are orphaned after an unexplained fire and sent to live with an older man who verbally abuses them, physically abuses one of them and blackmails a 14-year-old girl to marry him so that he can steal their family fortune - and that's just the first two episodes.Terrible things befall the Baudelaire orphans, played by newcomers Maline Weissman, Louis Hynes and Presley Smith. But, thanks to the acting talents of Neil Patrick Harris who plays Count Olaf, the nefarious yet stupid lead villain in this tale, the show gets away with murder - yes, loads of people die.This is not the first time that the books, written by Daniel Handler under the nom de plume Lemony Snicket, have been reinterpreted. A film in 2004 recounted the first three books in the 13-book series and starred Jim Carrey, Jude Law, Meryl Streep and Billy Connolly. It was an Oscar- winning success and yet wasn't able to capture the source material entirely. This time, however, Netflix gives each of the first four books two episodes of 50 minutes, allowing the story the space it needs to be fully realised. A diverse cast of talented actors including K Todd Freeman, Alfre Woodard, Usman Ally and Aasif Mandvi bring another layer of richness to the tale.WATCH the trailer for Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate EventsOver the course of roughly eight hours, the first season - of a promised three that will cover all 13 books - has plenty to keep up the action: a hook-handed henchman, "the incredibly deadly viper", whispers of a secret society, a hypnotic optometrist, mysteriously not quite dead parents... The show shines a light on an otherwise dark tale, with whimsical sets, playful banter and sheer silliness, getting the balance right for younger and older viewers alike.
