We invited 30 Sunday Times Food readers to act as judges.They were presented with three supermarket house brands of quiche Lorraine - with no branding - on separate plates.To ensure the taste test was fair, auditor Stephanie Pardoe was on hand to monitor the process, from removing the packaging and numbering the samples to the preparation and judging. Pardoe also collated the scores.Judges' comments: The pastry was thin, crisp and melt-in-the-mouth and tasted as if it was made with butter. It was a good quiche from the pastry to the filling, a moist custard described by the tasters as soft and fluffy with uniform pieces of ham.Price: R62 for 450gWhere to buy South Africa's creamiest, cheesiest macaroni cheese Judges' comments: A fairly good quiche with a nice look but a little on the eggy side. It was described by some tasters as fairly salty and all said the pastry was way too thick on the bottom.Price: R63.99 for 380g Judges' comments: The quiche looked a little flat and the pastry was underwhelming. It was considered quite dry and chewy. The filling was described as dry and on the bland side. The bacon, although generous, was chunky and not uniform.Price: R49.99 for 400g
