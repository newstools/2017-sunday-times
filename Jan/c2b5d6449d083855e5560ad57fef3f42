It s a fitting word to use in the context of Dasein: Exemption and Connection, the first solo exhibition by German artist Philipp Pieroth in South Africa. The artist who splits his time between Johannesburg, Cape Town and Berlin will be hosting a walkabout of the exhibition on Sunday, January 22 at The AGOG Gallery in the Maboneng Precinct.</img>'The Beginning' by Philipp Pieroth.

Image: SuppliedThe paintings in the exhibition explore themes of intimacy, connection, emotional toxicity, consumerism and disconnect.They are composed of aquarelle figures in various states of movement and inertia lone standing figures, others intimately connected to one another, some seeking a connection between them, others in the midst of broken bonds. In general my work is about how people interact and how they need each other. Nobody wants to be solitary. But all kinds of relationships are tricky, Pieroth tells The Sunday Times.The artist admits that he never used to enjoy speaking about his art, but says it helps people understand what his mindset was while he was creating it. He also sometimes gains new perspective about certain works because of the viewer s interpretations. I [used to be] very shy to talk about my work because it s so intimate and so private, he says. And I remember the first solo show I had, it was overwhelming to put this work on the wall, very emotional stuff. I felt very exposed and vulnerable. You can RSVP for the walkabout via the event's Facebook page. Look out for a feature on Philipp Pieroth and his work in an upcoming edition of Sunday Times Lifestyle.
