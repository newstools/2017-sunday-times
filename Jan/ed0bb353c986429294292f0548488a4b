The move, which follows some incidents of women reportedly being groped mid-flight by male passengers, has sparked something of an uproar in the press and on social media platforms.As of this week, six seats in the third row of economy-class cabins on the airline's Airbus A320 aircraft would be reserved - without extra fees - for female passengers who didn't want to be seated next to men, the airline announced. Airline's policy of weighing passengers sparks big, fat fury"We feel, as national carriers, it is our responsibility to enhance comfort level to female passengers," said Meenakshi Malik, Air India's general manager.To qualify, however, the female passengers must be travelling solo, Ashwani Lohani, the chairman and managing director of Air India, told The Hindu newspaper.The decision went down like a lead balloon with much of the public.Several commentators on Twitter called the move "moronic"."As a woman, this is insulting. My gender doesn't make me an invalid. This is what modern-day sexism looks like," wrote one.In an editorial, the Hindustan Times called the decision a "patronising, sexist move".The national president of the Air Passengers Association of India, D Sudhakara Reddy, was quoted by The Telegraph as saying, "It is an impractical move and will lead to gender discrimination. The airline should not go ahead with the plan."Other commentators tried to take the conversation in a completely different direction, such as the "Disgruntled Passenger", who tweeted: "I don't want reserved seats. I want cleaner seats. Please look into it."While several train and bus services in India already offer seats reserved for female passengers, this is an unprecedented move for an airline.It was also recently announced that the airline would be carrying handcuffs on flights - in order to restrain unruly passengers in the most extreme cases.The decisions follow two incidents of female passengers allegedly being groped by males on Air India flights.Last month, a woman travelling from Mumbai to the US said a man had groped her as she slept. The male passenger, who was originally seated in business class, reportedly changed his seat to sit next to the woman in economy class before the incident took place.Earlier this month, a female flight attendant said she had been molested by a male passenger on a flight from Oman to Delhi.Both men were reported to local police upon landing.
