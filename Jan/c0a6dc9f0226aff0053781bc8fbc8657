When Manchester United played Paris St-Germain (PSG) in the summer of 2015, the thoroughness with which we prepared under Louis van Gaal meant even for a friendly match it was my job to analyse the opposition's key strengths, and identify ways to stop them.Despite PSG's many big names, it was obvious watching the footage that Zlatan Ibrahimovic was the star of the show. Uganda's Cranes want to reach heights of '78 again He dropped so deep to get possession he would be in midfield at times and, despite his goalscoring record for the club, there were periods when he was way away from goal.At PSG Ibrahimovic controlled the ball and brought others, like Edinson Cavani and Lucas Moura, into the game.He was an attacking point, a man to whom the ball was played up to in the knowledge that it would stick.Now, as archrivals Liverpool prepare to face United's No9 at Old Trafford today, they will have noticed that, for Jos Mourinho's team, Ibrahimovic is much more of an orthodox centre-forward.He holds his position, he makes the runs you would expect of an out-and-out striker. Although, one thing remains the same as at PSG - he still scores lots of goals.Ibrahimovic has been a great signing for United, and a very consistent performer. He is one of those few players in the game who you can say has an aura rather than just a reputation.There have been comparisons made with the effect that Eric Cantona had when he joined United in 1992 and then Henrik Larsson in 2007, and I would agree that similarities exist.At 26, Cantona was considerably younger than Ibrahimovic and he was coming in to a very experienced side.Just as the Frenchman, Cantona, had the absolute trust of Alex Ferguson so Ibrahimovic seems to have that relationship with Mourinho.That is what good managers do with top players ... they back them unequivocally. Like Ibrahimovic, Swede Larsson was 35 when he came on loan to United in 2007.He was a superb professional whose influence was very strong in the dressing room.Liverpool are ready to thrust Philippe Coutinho back into the starting lineup for today's crucial trip to Manchester United as J rgen Klopp seeks an immediate response to their EFL Cup disappointment.Coutinho played the last 29 minutes of his side's 1-0 defeat in the first leg of their semifinal against Southampton.His brief cameo demonstrated what Liverpool have been missing during his six-week absence with an ankle injury. The Elephants unleash super weapon Wilfried Zaha on opposition The Brazilian has not started a league match since November 26, when a 2-0 victory over Sunderland returned Klopp's side to the top of the Premier League.The Merseyside club have since dropped seven points and trail leaders Chelsea by five as the strength in depth of Klopp's squad has been tested.Now the German coach is ready to turn to the Brazilian at Old Trafford, and will decide over the next two training sessions whether captain Jordan Henderson is ready to join him.Henderson trained alongside another recent absentee, Joel Matip, at Melwood on Thursday, but both are struggling to make the game. Henderson is most likely to force his way into Klopp's plans as he tries to shrug off a heel injury.Matip is thought to be some time off a comeback.Coutinho's fitness offers some relief, with James Milner saying: "He's a top player and every team in the world would miss him."It's a credit to the boys the amount of goals we have been scoring without him, but it's great to see him back. The more minutes he gets, the more comfortable he'll get again."It's not easy when you've been out that long, still thinking about the injury, so it was positive for him to get some minutes. The more he plays, the more influential he will be for us again." Though the Southampton defeat was the worst Liverpool display of the season, they have enjoyed enough notable victories recently - not least against Manchester City - to retain their title aspirations ahead of meeting Jos Mourinho's side.However, Liverpool and United meet in different circumstances to their Anfield encounter in October.The question heading into what was a dour stalemate was how United would stop Klopp's swaggering side. Now Klopp will be assessing how to get that swagger back.
