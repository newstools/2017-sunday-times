A 3-2 loss at Anfield leaves Liverpool well behind the leaders and having to reset ambitions towards Champions League qualification rather than catching Chelsea.All the goals came in an astonishing second half, with Fernando Llorente leading the charge for the Welsh side.Liverpool came from two down thanks to Roberto Firmino, but Gylfi Sigurdsson restored the visitors' advantage on 74 minutes in a match with massive repercussions at both ends of the table. Conte pours oil on Blues' troubled watersPhilippe Coutinho started his first Premier League since November, but Joel Matip's reprieve from Fifa did not result in an instant recall. The now (officially) ex-Cameroon international started on the bench.Klopp charitably suggested he had never seen a transformation in a side comparable to Swansea since Paul Clement took charge. It was prophetic given what followed.In a parallel world, Clement could have been in the home dugout alongside Carlo Ancelloti, when his erstwhile mentor was in contention for the job Klopp accepted.Clement would have enjoyed the view as Liverpool toiled in the chill.The home side created early opportunities for Emre Can and Adam Lallana, the latter attempted an overhead kick from close range after the best move of the half.But too often the home side squandered the final pass, their recent frustration against deep defending teams apparent again.They miss Sadio Man .Swansea were also closest to a breakthrough on 19 minutes.Llorente played in Tom Carroll - making his second Swansea debut after a loan spell last season - and the midfielder's shot deflected off Dejan Lovren onto the post.This was not the Liverpool of earlier in the campaign, that had many home games won by half time.Belief in the stands that they will sustain a title challenge is absent.Klopp's pre-match calls for a European-style atmosphere was not received until the team fell behind, and probably won't be unless Liverpool are still in contention in the coming months. Liverpool's former captain and talisman Steven Gerrard will return to his roots as part of the academy's coaching set-up, the Premier League club announced this weekend That seems unlikely. Everything, on and off the pitch, seemed far too hospitable for the visitors.The focus had to come quickly in the second half when Swansea took a 48th-minute lead.Sigurdsson's corner was won by Federico Fernandez, and Wayne Routledge teed it up for Llorente to poke past Simon Mignolet.The Spaniard's second was far superior, meeting Carroll's cross with a bullet header past the keeper.Liverpool responded with Firmino's header on 55 minutes and suddenly Anfield woke up. The Brazilian, short of goals recently, brilliantly volleyed in an equaliser on 69 minutes and it felt like Klopp's title hopes were being restored, but more sloppy defending allowed Sigurddson to restore Swansea's advantage and take them out of the bottom three.Liverpool's former captain and talisman Steven Gerrard will return to his roots as part of the academy's coaching set-up, the Premier League club announced this weekend.Gerrard, who made 710 appearances for his boyhood club during 17 years at Anfield, will begin his new role in February. Cameroon battle their demons"It feels like completing the circle; returning to the place where professionally it all began," the 36-year-old told the club's website."However, this isn't based on emotion - it's about what I can offer and contribute to Liverpool."Gerrard ended his playing career in November when he announced his retirement a week after confirming he would not return to play for MLS side LA Galaxy.A return to Liverpool in some capacity has always been on the cards and news that he will be working with the club's youngsters will be welcomed."I don't think I need to explain to people what this football club means to me," said Gerrard, who led Liverpool to an unlikely Champions League final win over Milan in 2005."When I knew coming back was a serious option I wanted to make sure it was a substantive role."Meeting with [academy manager] Alex Inglethorpe, seeing the work they are doing and want to do in the future at Kirkby, it just felt right."
