Over the past five months or so our cricketers have gone about their business efficiently and with a sense of purpose, unlike many other elements in our land. They beat New Zealand here in August and, never an easy task, Australia away in November. Their current domination of Sri Lanka has added to the pleasure of winning. We know greatness in cricket when we see it And they have done all this against daunting odds. A year ago these Proteas were down and out: beaten at home by England, and their future looking bleak. On top of that, two of their best players were sidelined by injuries. Today it's become difficult to accommodate the pair, who are expected to resume playing soon. The turnaround has been phenomenal. Along the way, the team have reached transformation targets, found a new captain who is now firmly established, polished a fast-bowling gem and helped a struggling star rediscover his lost form. Amid all this, they have had to deal with a talent drain. The players revealed a calmness and maturity in losing valued teammates. The same cannot be said of the administrators, the dreaded "suits", in Cricket South Africa who were their usual peevish selves. Anyway, the Kolpak route to the riches of English cricket will be closed once Britain leaves the EU. Let's hope the pettiness of the officials, especially that of the team coach, does not infect the players, who have a heavy workload ahead. This year there's an autumn tour to New Zealand, followed by a winter one to England and an international tournament. India are guests next summer, as are the Australians. Our players need to stay on top of their game.
