Back at full strength and in mean mood after having lost the T20 series in Cape Town on Wednesday, South Africa dealt a decisive, psychological blow to the tourists by cruising home with all of 94 balls to spare. Chasing a mere 182 for victory, opening pair Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock were under no pressure to go hard from the outset.They adopted a watchful approach at first in the face of some accurate bowling from Sri Lankan seamers Nuwan Kulasekara and Suranga Lakmal. But, once they had settled, the duo played some delightful strokes and rushed to 71 in the 14th over before De Kock lost his wicket to Lakshan Sandakan for 34.Amla went on to register his 31st ODI half-century, and then, with 51 runs remaining for the win, chipped a delivery back to gentle seamer Asela Gunaratne to be dismissed for 57.It was then left to captain AB de Villiers (30 not out), playing in his first ODI since June last year, and Faf du Plessis, with a fine, unbeaten 55 to drive home the impressive win. It was a performance reminiscent of how the Proteas dominated the tourists in the test series, and Sri Lanka will need to lift their efforts considerably for the second match in Durban on Wednesday.But even though the side has been performing well under Russell Domingo of late, it appears his future may be in the balance.In a release from CSA pertaining to them retaining the six-franchise system and the restructuring of senior provincial cricket, the following paragraph appeared at the end: "The Board of Directors also resolved to commence the recruitment process for the appointment of the Proteas head coach to take charge after the tour to the UK until after the 2019 edition of the ICC World Cup." A request to interview Domingo after the match was denied by the team's management.A 70km/h westerly wind battered the ground yesterday assisted by the odd shower of aqueous bullets making matters challenging for batsmen, bowlers and fielders alike. This, on a day when even the region's most ardent kite-surfers were scurrying for cover.Sri Lanka stuttered and stumbled to a disappointing 181 all out, with only Kusal Mendis standing tall with 62 runs in his 18th ODI.Mendis, who is built quite close to the ground, appeared less perturbed by the awkward conditions than the remainder of his teammates and produced a strong showing for the tourists. He started his innings by clubbing seven boundaries before he got his first single.Having lost the toss, Sri Lanka knew they needed a good start if they were to keep South Africa's blood-thirsty attack at bay. But they were hamstrung early on in the piece when left-arm seamer Wayne Parnell struck in his first and second overs from the Park Drive End to remove openers Niroshan Dickwella and Sandun Weerakkody with only 14 on the board.Mendis was joined by Dinesh Chandimal and the pair held their ground for some time in posting 72 for the third wicket. But after that partnership was broken, with Chandimal (22) being bowled after misreading Imran Tahir's googly, the Sri Lankans never quite recovered.Mendis progressed to his eighth half-century in this format before he, too, fell victim to Tahir, who trapped him leg before wicket. The right-hander ended up striking 10 fours in his 94-ball innings.Tahir then picked up his third scalp in the form of captain Upul Tharanga, who played a rash stroke under the circumstances to be caught by JP Duminy at short cover. He was the pick of the Proteas bowlers with 3/26.
