Party leaders are trying to distance the ANC from the project, which could land it in trouble with the Electoral Court.Court papers filed by public relations entrepreneur Sihle Bolani revealed that the ANC - through a letter signed by Jacobs - had committed to paying her R1-million for her role in a planned campaign to use "dirty tricks" to discredit the opposition ahead of last year's local government elections.The project, which turned out to be a failure, is said to have been the brainchild of ANC activist and social media celebrity Shaka Sisulu.War Room: We waged an aerial battle against hostile media says SisuluThe ANC at first distanced itself from the project, but a formal letter signed by Jacobs linked it directly to the "war room".Luthuli House insiders say Jacobs was called to a meeting on Wednesday at which secretary-general Gwede Mantashe gave him a tongue-lashing and questioned where he got permission to make a payment of R100,000 to Bolani as part of the R1-million settlement agreement he signed off on.Asked for comment, Mantashe said: "Give us space to deal with our issues."He insisted Sisulu's project was not authorised by any ANC leader."It is no different from any other person who raises money for yourself in the name of the ANC. It is a criminal offence ... where is the money [he raised]? He wants us to pay now". He added that "a thief is a thief."Tell him to show you the contract that he signed with us."Attempts since Thursday to contact Jacobs were unsuccessful.In court papers, Bolani said the project aimed to undermine DA and EFF campaigns and advance the ANC's agenda without a link to the party.Black ops reports intended to discredit me and the ANC: Sisulu breaks his silenceSisulu said in a statement he and "an informal grouping" of ANC supporters had decided to help the ANC's communication team and went to donors to raise funds. He said that while they did raise some money for the project, donors were overcommitted and the project fell through due to lack of funds.Sisulu did not answer detailed questions sent to him, saying he was pursuing legal action on the matter.ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize, who is responsible for the party's fundraising and procurement, said he was not aware of Jacobs's settlement and subsequent payment and only heard of it through the media."All fundraising initiatives need to be co-ordinated with the treasurer-general's office and no parallel initiatives or unauthorised use of the ANC or the treasurer-general's office is permissible. If identified, disciplinary action may be taken," he said.On Sisulu procuring Bolani's services, Mkhize said all procurement and contracts must be authorised by him, otherwise the party could not make any payment. He said he was investigating the war room matter and "actions will be taken".Jacobs could not be reached for comment.hunterq@sundaytimes.co.za
