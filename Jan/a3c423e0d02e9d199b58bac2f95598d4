Presentation of the report follows a meeting on Friday when Zuma's fellow members of the ANC's top six leadership gave him political guidance on the issue.The meeting at Mahlambandlopfu also sparked speculation about a pending cabinet reshuffle, because top six meetings are normally held on Mondays at Luthuli House.The interministerial committee, convened by Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe, is expected to give Zuma a short-term solution while he awaits the final report of the judicial inquiry into the feasibility of free higher education. The final report is expected in June. Blade's plan falls flat with #FeesMustFallThe Sunday Times understands that Zuma wants help for students to go beyond that announced last year by Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande - a cap of 8% on tuition increases and the freezing of fee increases for students from households with incomes below R600,000.Well-placed sources said security-cluster ministers wanted Nzimande to take the lead in dealing with students, and would present no plans to counter possible renewed protests."For the last two years, the security cluster was at the forefront of dealing with the protests, resulting in widespread criticism," one source said."They are now looking to Nzimande to take charge in negotiating with student leaders before they decide on a security plan to deal with any protest."The committee comprises Nzimande, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, Minister of Science and Technology Naledi Pandor, Minister of Justice Michael Masutha, Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, State Security Minister David Mahlobo and Minister of Police Nathi Nhleko.Nzimande, his deputy Mduduzi Manana and director-general Gwebinkundla Qonde have held a series of meetings with vice-chancellors, student leaders and other interested groups.Nzimande and Manana met Zuma on Thursday to give him feedback on these discussions.Manana told the Sunday Times yesterday that the inter-ministerial committee would also brief Zuma about the Department of Higher Education's readiness for the new academic year. He said officials would be deployed to tertiary institutions across the country.Nzimande calls on college students to protest peacefully"We are ready because when we spoke to our stakeholders we agreed on the 8% cap. That means the missing middle and the poor will not be affected by the fee increases, only those above R600,000."We also communicated with all the 26 SRC presidents, who agreed and committed themselves to await the outcomes of the commission. They are eagerly awaiting free education but are committed to wait for the commission's report," said Manana.But attempts at disruption when campuses reopened remained a possibility."There are those who are not part of the SRC who have been leading protests and we hear that they are going to demand free education now and don't want to wait for the outcomes of the commission," Manana said."There is no real reason for disruptions as all the universities have committed themselves to taking charge and implementing all the decisions we agreed on." - Additional Reporting by and Thanduxolo Jikahunterq@sundaytimes.co.za
