Crooner and aspiring far right-wing politician Steve Hofmeyr took opportunism to new heights when he realised that the A-list of US singers considered President Donald Trump the scum of the earth and refused to perform at his inauguration: onse Steve volunteered for the job.

But his fellow rightwinger, womaniser and fact-free zone did not heed Steve's Lorelei-like offer, so our Mampara still waits, hour after hour, for the call that will never come.
