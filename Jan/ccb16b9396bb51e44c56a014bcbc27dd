Retail stores and online selling sites say they have seen a spike in the number of people returning December purchases or selling them online.Karla Levick, OLX South Africa's head of marketing, said January was one of the online marketplace's busiest months for posts or adverts."This is due to a couple of reasons - people are short on cash because of holiday overspending, and people are clearing out old items they no longer need. Twas the season of wait a lot for thousands of Takealot customers"Unwanted Christmas gifts are a smaller percentage; however we still see them every year. It's a fairly simple way to get rid of a gift you don't want in exchange for cash."As the item is generally new, if a good discount is given on the retail price, these items sell very quickly," Levick said.Gumtree recorded a 10% increase in listings using the term "unwanted gifts" in January so far this year compared to last January.Gumtree head of communications Estelle Nagel said: "We all tend to overspend slightly over the holidays, and when January rolls around, extra cash is needed to cover the shortfall as well as necessities, such as school fees."And of course, there are always gifts that aren't useful or liked, and in general, people would rather sell them than hoard them."A Cape Town single mom said she was selling her 32-inch Sony Bravia TV set on Gumtree because she had to pay for back-to-school supplies for her children."I'm selling to provide for three children whose father pays no maintenance. January is specifically bad because of going back to school," said the woman, who did not want to be named. "Each child costs around R5,000 for school things, but January is bad in general, as school holidays are more expensive."I've had a good response on Gumtree. I've sold electronics, my old phone - not just because it's January but in general to provide for my kids."</img>Ballito local Angelo Neil says he sold his surfboard, which was a Christmas gift, online to get it partially refunded.
