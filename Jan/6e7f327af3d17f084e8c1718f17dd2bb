She said the time was not long enough to teach the "full theoretical spectrum of hospitality".In a summons issued last month, the academy said Von Ulmenstein's writing had been widely read on various platforms, including Facebook.</img>Christine von Ulmenstein, a guest-house owner is being sued for R500,000 by the South Africa Butler Academy for defamation.
