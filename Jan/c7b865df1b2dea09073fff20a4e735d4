Despite all that we have read - and unfortunately heard - from President Trump himself, I do think that on the balance of probabilities, Trump may just turn out to be a very good president.I know that may seem hard to believe but let's take our personal emotions out of the situation for a minute and seek to ignore, even for a moment, what Robert de Niro calls a "divisive, racist, misogynist, ignorant" administration.First, Trump won. Contrary to the expectations of many - including the "'in the know" analysts and poll administrators - he was most in touch with the fears and anxieties of US citizens and used these to win the election. Markets all over still buffeted by TrumpThe truth is that, although a lot of the rhetoric is anti-Trump and Hillary Clinton won more votes, Trump was elected.Perhaps the uncomfortable truth for the countless US citizens who have come out against a Trump presidency is the reality that many of their fellow citizens in the "land of the free" are exactly like Trump.Perhaps President Trump is the most American president the US has ever had.Just as he was able to win the elections against steep odds, he may just be able restore the faith of citizens in the US.Second, Trump is no beginner in negotiating hard deals for selfish commercial gain.Thanks to a "small" $1-million loan from his father, Trump's first big project was the Commodore Hotel in Manhattan, New York. According to the BBC: "At the time of his first major deal, many buildings in Manhattan were facing foreclosure; the Commodore itself owed $1.5-million in debt and New York was not seen as the luxury vacation spot it is today. The investment was a big risk for the young developer."Using the negotiating skills he talks about so shamelessly on the campaign trail, Trump convinced New York City to give the hotel a 40-year tax break that saved $160-million. In 1996 he sold his half of the hotel to Hyatt for $142-million."We are all fully aware of the historically rocky relationship between the US and Russia. Is it a mere coincidence that there seems to be a "bromance" developing between Trump and Russia's President Vladimir Putin, notwithstanding 17 US intelligence sources unanimously concluding that "Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election"?"Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for president-elect Trump," the intelligence services concluded. Davos logic ruffles feathers in SASo why is Trump suddenly homies with Putin? Perhaps Trump smells an opportunity. Although that may initially be an opportunity for only himself and his cronies, it could pan out as an opportunity for the US. Then there is the UK, which, since its big decision to leave the EU, has been on a charm offensive, punting its virtues to any market willing to listen to the story.Judging by Prime Minister Theresa May's spirited address earlier this week on the UK's detailed plans to exit the EU, it would appear Trump has found himself another, perhaps more flirtatious, romance.May needs Trump, and Trump is all too ready to be needed.The EU is not keen to surrender all the perks of playing outside the union to May, and Trump is all too happy to be the knight in shining armour - and you can rest assured he will use his position of leverage to the full.So although many are forecasting doom for the 45th US president, he may just have a few tricks up his sleeve and spring a few surprises by actually making America - and only America - "great again"Khumalo is the chief investment officer of MSG Afrika Group and presents "Power Business" on Power 98.7 at 5pm, Monday to Thursday
