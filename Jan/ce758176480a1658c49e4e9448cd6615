For more than 80 years, large strip mines operated across the region, stretching south from Namibia along the arid coast of the Northern Cape. Thousands of locals worked for De Beers and other smaller mining companies, commuting on company buses or living in one of De Beers' two fully funded company towns.After waves of retrenchments, De Beers finally closed its Namaqualand mines in 2009, citing declining resources, weaker diamond prices and the recent global financial crisis.</img>TREASURE TROVE: Komaggas, in the heart of the Namaqualand diamond zone Image: Shaun SwinglerTREASURE TROVE: Komaggas, in the heart of the Namaqualand diamond zone Image: Shaun SwinglerEntire communities were left without work, but enough diamonds remain to lure hundreds of people to risk their lives and break the law.Because of its sensitive nature, the illicit diamond trade is difficult to access but over three years I have formed relationships with several diggers, aiming to expose the poverty and desperation driving diggers - youths and grandmothers alike - to seek their fortunes in the ground.</img>A TWIST OF SAND: Joe, an illicit digger, sifts sand that will be searched for diamonds Image: Shaun SwinglerA TWIST OF SAND: Joe, an illicit digger, sifts sand that will be searched for diamonds Image: Shaun SwinglerWorking by hand, and with rudimentary equipment, most diggers target gravel seams just above the bedrock. Due to their high density, diamonds settled beneath layers of sediment after being flushed from the Kimberley region to the west coast millions of years ago.Most diggers excavate shallow pits in disused mining areas, filling plastic sacks with gravel to sieve and rinse. They can toil for weeks without luck, sleeping in nearby bush camps. They sell any diamonds they find on the black market, earning substantially less than the stones are worth.</img>TWAK INNIE KOERANT: Challa, Iron and Ben share a newspaper cigarette Image: Shaun SwinglerTWAK INNIE KOERANT: Challa, Iron and Ben share a newspaper cigarette Image: Shaun SwinglerCut and polished, these diamonds bleed into legal supply chains and ultimately sell in jewellery stores around the world. It is illegal to possess rough diamonds in South Africa without a licence.Some diggers take far greater risks and burrow beneath the walls of old mine pits. One such tunnel, at a site called Bontekoe, collapsed in May 2012, killing 10 men.</img>TUNNEL VISION: Rasta prepares to clamber out of the tunnel, using footholds carved into the shaft's walls Image: Shaun SwinglerTUNNEL VISION: Rasta prepares to clamber out of the tunnel, using footholds carved into the shaft's walls Image: Shaun SwinglerA short distance from Bontekoe, diggers still work in unsafe tunnels. Some tunnels have vertical shafts deeper than 10m, with claustrophobic tunnels accessible only on all fours, that cut 20m into the earth.If diggers switch their torches off, the tunnels are impenetrably dark.</img>PROSPECT OF SLEEP: After a day's digging, Challa and Brian go to their campsite for the night Image: Shaun SwinglerPROSPECT OF SLEEP: After a day's digging, Challa and Brian go to their campsite for the night Image: Shaun SwinglerInside the tunnels it is damp and difficult to breathe. Diggers chisel the rock face for hours on end, hauling heavy gravel loads to the surface.Diamonds transformed the South African economy in the 19th century, but that wealth was not equally shared.</img>FORBIDDEN BOUNTY: An illicit diamond dealer shows off his stock Image: Shaun SwinglerFORBIDDEN BOUNTY: An illicit diamond dealer shows off his stock Image: Shaun Swingler
