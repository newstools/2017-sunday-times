The six bodies might have been removed, but the grisly evidence of a six-man massacre inside an alleged Hammarsdale drug den remains.At about 10pm on Friday, unknown men knocked on the door of the home in the Georgedale area of Hammarsdale, west of Durban. Moments later, six people lay dead and another was severely injured.The attack on three siblings - including one who had previously been arrested on drug-related charges - and their friends has left the local community reeling. Neighbours said it was an open secret that drugs were consumed and sold at the house.As detectives from the provincial task team tried to piece together exactly what had happened, frightened neighbours said they feared gang retribution, speculating that the massacre might be linked to drug wars ravaging the area.Siblings Hlengiwe Dubazana, Siyanda Kubheka and Siphelele Kubheka were at home when their friends Zama Mthalane, Mnce Goqo, Siphamandla Mavundla and Bongani Ntuli - believed to have all been in their 20s - came to visit.

She was out doing her hair at the time of the attack.A hysterical Zandile, who could barely speak, said it looked as if "animals had been slaughtered" inside the house.Dubazana's aunt, Thandi Dubazana, spoke to the lone survivor, Ntuli, on Friday night in hospital. He told her that the seven were all in the house when there was a knock at the door."When he opened the door, the assailants opened fire. They were shooting indiscriminately and following their victims to other rooms," she said.It appeared Hlengiwe and Zama had been dishing up in the kitchen, as food was strewn all over the floor.Neighbour Dumisani Khumalo said they heard the gunshots at around 10pm. He and Siphelele had grown up playing soccer together, he said.He was adamant that the murders were linked to the drug war."I cannot say much but some of those that died are known in local drug circles. I suspect their rivals came to stop them," said the former member of the local community policing forum.Police have confirmed they are looking into drug links.Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said the street drug whoonga, or nyaope, four bullet casings and bullets were found at the scene.
