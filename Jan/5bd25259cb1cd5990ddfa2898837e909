She has also worked on radio and in advertising agency spaces, balancing multiple jobs with a keen interest in fashion.She tells us more about her favourite things:My favourite designer changes as my personal aesthetic deepens. For now, it's Off-White designer Virgil Abloh. In my opinion, he is the reigning king of street wear, which has taken over what we knew as "high fashion". He has found a way to make street wear luxurious without compromising its athleisure aesthetic.I'm a sneakers girl. I love Vans and have about 20 pairs. I'm also a fan of the Jordan 1 sneaker, something about the silhouette just works for me. In a perfect world I'd probably wear Rick Owens sneakers - I'm obsessed with this luxury brand.My top three local sneaker stores are: Lost Property in Cape Town; Shelf Life (Joburg &amp; Cape Town), and Dip Street (011-027-5508) in Joburg.Three beauty products I swear by: Nivea sun protect SPF 50 (R165); Coconut oil, from the Food Lovers Market house brand (R45), and Raw Shea butter from Body Shop (R170).My favourite scents are Tom Ford Velvet Orchid (R2,100) and Bvlgari Omnia Coral EDT 65ml (R1,300).I'm reading Grace Jones's 'I'll Never Write My Memoirs'.My favourite destination is New York City - for the shopping, of course, and also the art scene. There are amazing galleries and fashion and art are my two favourite things. Follow Lethabo 'Boogy' Maboi on Instagram for more style inspiration: @boogymaboi .
