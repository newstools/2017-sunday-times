CORRECTION: In a previous version of this article it was erroneously stated that yoga instructor and personal trainer Theresa Moodie offers Boxing Yoga classes at her gym in Bryanston, Johannesburg. Moodie held a once-off Boxing Yoga class last October in collaboration with Yaela Orelowitz, who is the local representative for Boxing Yoga. Moodie often collaborates with other instructors, such as Orelowitz, to encourage cross-training of different modalities.
