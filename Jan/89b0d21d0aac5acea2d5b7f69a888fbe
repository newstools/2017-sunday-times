This is reflected in a thriving menu of more boutique fitness workout choices in urban hubs and spas," said consumer trends analyst Daphne Kasriel-Alexander."Furthermore, consumers are aware that eating habits directly influence quality of life. This is fuelling unprecedented demand for healthier eating options with fitness-promoting attributes sought in supplements, beauty products and even pet food by consumers willing to pay for them."Celebrity chef Siba Mtongana - host of Siba's Table on Food Network - is embracing the clean-living trend with gusto. She has lost 10kg in six months."Now that I have had my three kids, I felt it was time to give more focus to an active lifestyle and going back to a cleaner diet."I've always enjoyed athleisure wear and being on this journey cultivated that even more. I'm generally a fun and energetic person, so I guess this trend works for me."Health and wellness is on everyone's lips these days."Mtongana said healthy living - which includes running, skipping and hiking, eating salads, seafood and fresh fruit, and taking wellness holidays with her family - had become her lifestyle and not a life sentence.Kasriel-Alexander said that at a time when consuming "stuff", once an indicator of wealth, was taking a back seat, "the lack of things, of excess fat, of wayward thoughts even, now defines aspiration and is at the heart of the consumer interest in wellness".</img>Lisa Raleigh believes clean living "is not a trend or hobby, it is a lifestyle.
