Users include some of the medal winners at the Rio Olympics last year and US basketball star LeBron James.But that's the catch.WHOOP is targeting professional and elite athletes, not the run-of-the-mill active adult.

After assessing this data, the WHOOP tells the user how much sleep they need that night to recover.This device measures up to 150MB of data per athlete each day.WHOOP claims on its website that after only four months its users are, on average, sleeping 41 minutes more a night, drinking alcohol before bedtime far less often, cutting their injury rate by 60%, increasing their heart rate variability by eight milliseconds and experiencing lower resting heart rates."We believe that the data we're collecting on athletes is unprecedented," said company CEO Will Ahmed.Perhaps somebody should sponsor WHOOPs for the Springboks in 2017?
