Phillip Roodt of Mookgophong called black people cockroaches who stole money to go on holiday and said he hoped they would drown one by one. This leper from Limpopo needs a lesson in entomology. How about an orange overall, a bucket and a rag to help him with his studies? He should be made to get down on his knees, scrub his way through that university called jail, and then write a dissertation on real cockroaches and other crawlies. There is a prison cell with your name on the door, Mampara.
