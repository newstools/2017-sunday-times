Zwane s comments come after Sibanye subsidiary Sibanye Platinum lodged summonses against the minister and three high-ranking safety officials for R26.8-million to recompense the company for losses incurred during a safety stoppage at the Kroondal platinum mine that the company argued was not proportional with the Mine Health and Safety Act.Zwane said in a statement on Wednesday evening that he had not yet received the summons from Sibanye and is thus unable to comment on the details at this stage .AngloGold Ashanti successfully overturned a safety stoppage at its Kopanang mine in the labour court last year.Fica bill is constitutional say top lawyers It is unfortunate that both companies are choosing to repeatedly suggest through their utterances in the media that they are refusing to comply with the mining laws of the country Zwane said in a statement. This is especially concerning given the fact that the platinum and gold sectors were the biggest contributors to fatalities in 2016. Together these two companies were responsible for the death of 19 mineworkers in 2016 he added.The companies and the Chamber of Mines have stressed they do not oppose safety stoppages where they are justified but want the action ordered by the department s safety inspectorate to be proportional to the violation of the act.In terms of the act the inspectors can issue a Section 54 notice ordering the closure of a mine to address problem areas.In a number of cases that have come to light entire mines have been stopped at enormous cost for localised infringements of the act. It is this type of action from safety inspectors that mining companies want to address. Profit-making and the health and safety of workers are not mutually exclusive and it is unacceptable that these companies are choosing to cheapen the lives of mineworkers in this manner Zwane said. Health and safety should be a priority for all stakeholders in the industry and we are clear that if companies cannot mine safely they should not be mining at all and should allow other potential holders who will respect the laws of our country to continue mining he said.
