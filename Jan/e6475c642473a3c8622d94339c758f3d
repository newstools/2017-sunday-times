The 47-year-old Thysse - a former South African and Commonwealth super-middleweight champion - was, after all, up against East London's Ayanda Matiti and Mthatha's Mbali "Don Queen" Zantsi.Matiti, the overwhelming favourite, was expected to simply show up and claim the trophy and Thysse was supposed to take his placeand politely applaud when the winner was announced. Thysse makes a mockery of betting odds to become SA boxing's Promoter of the YearBut things didn't go according to the expected script and even Thysse himself was stunned when he was announced as the winner."I never saw myself winning this trophy, especially when I was contesting it against Matiti and Mbali Zantsi," said Thysse. "The mere nomination last year was enough of a shock.""Gratitude to Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula and to the board of Boxing SA for bringing back the awards." Boxing SA's sought-after Boxer of the Year award went to the country's biggest drawcard, the charismatic Xolisani "Nomeva" Ndongeni. The 26-year-old is limited skilfully as a fighter, but his will to fight has won him fans and he can single-handedly fill up boxing venues to capacity.In the female section, Bukiwe "Anaconda" Nonina was voted female boxer of the year.She defended her South African bantamweight belt five times and claimed the ownership of Boxing SA's belt. Nonina is the only South African female champion to achieve that feat since women began boxing professionally in 2006. Mlandeli Tengimfene took the Manager of the Year award. TMG Digital Sowetan journalist Bongani Magasela won the chairperson's award.
