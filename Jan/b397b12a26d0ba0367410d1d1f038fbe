Michel Temer, who took office last August after the impeachment of his predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, in a government funding scandal, had to cancel the order after it was leaked to the public.Among the choice items on the list for 2017 were 1.5 tons of chocolate cake, 500 cartons of H agen-Dazs ice cream, 120 jars of Nutella spread and 1,500 litres of coconut water.Temer had promised to pull Brazil out of the worst recession it had experienced for more than half a century when he took office ."Temer's team needs to get out of its comfort zone and see what is happening in the country," said Carlos Manhanelli, the chairman of the Brazilian Association of Political Consultants.Temer is facing trial at Brazil's electoral court over alleged illegal campaign financing in the 2014 presidential elections involving both him and Rousseff. They both deny wrongdoing.If found guilty, he could be forced from power less than a year after taking office, leaving Brazil's congress to pick a third president to complete the presidential term.However, the man currently topping the polls for the 2018 election - former president Luiz In cio Lula da Silva - is also facing corruption charges for allegedly helping a relation of his former wife win a construction contract in Angola.
