Q: We live in Johannesburg and have made a resolution to get away at least once a month this year. To make this economically possible, we would like to investigate camping in or near Gauteng as an option, bearing in mind we have a six-year-old child. Are there safe places in which to camp? - Mary LeithThere are a host of options, from tented camps where you can share accommodation in relative luxury to camping sites where you have to do your own thing, apart from having ablution facilities to hand.The Joburg website lists what it says are the best 10 campsites near Johannesburg, but you may not think of Golden Gate in the Free State as one of them.The closest options are on the Vaal river and dam (when it's full), in Muldersdrift and the Magaliesberg, and at Roodeplaat dam.Here are random examples of both options - rough camping or more luxurious permanent tents with facilities.Vaal Streams provides reasonably priced camping sites for your own tents with views of the river in the valley below.They charge R250 per site per night, R100 per person entry fee, R75 per vehicle, more for minibuses.If you don't want to commit to the expense of buying a tent before you and your child decide you like camping, they have 2-3 person tents for hire at R150 for two nights.Bush Willow Tented Camp is in Muldersdrift, just 30 minutes from both Johannesburg and Pretoria. It has a great location in indigenous bush on the banks of the Blaauwbank river.They have 10 walk-in tents that sleep up to six people each and have a toilet, hot indoor shower and kitchenette. Take your own linen or hire it there.The weekend rate is R1,060 per night per tent with a minimum of two nights. There is a heated swimming pool, river fishing and marked walking trails to keep you busy - and a recreation room with TV if the kid insists. Do you have a query for our travel expert?
