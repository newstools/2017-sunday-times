Now one of South Africa's biggest public hospitals has taken green leadership to a new height and massively reduced its carbon footprint in the process.Standing next to Groote Schuur Hospital's huge boilers this week, head of engineering Denton Smith said: "We didn't spend a fortune on flashy new equipment. It is about correct maintenance."In 2014 Groote Schuur joined the Global Green Hospitals network and stepped up efforts to protect the environment.Gauteng's most dangerous and safest state hospitalsAccording to research in the South African Medical Journal, the hospital has halved the amount of coal and water it uses and increased recycling by about 50% in six months.It has replaced polystyrene cups and packaging with paper-based products, reduced food waste by using local farmers, and cut the number of expired pharmaceuticals by changing systems."We managed to save on water and coal through simple solutions like fixing every leak, removing the old steam lines and making sure there was no thermal loss in the pipeworks," said Smith.The spreadsheets of carbon footprints, water temperature and maintenance plans are balanced by the "heart" behind the initiative. "Whatever we do here is for the patient," said Groote Schuur chief artisan Mogamat Williams.Ebrahim Cassiem, in charge of waste management, said recycling bins were a simple solution.Anand Prabu, a senior energy campaigner at Greenpeace Africa, said: "We need more such champions in different energy sectors."Prabu said more than 80% of South Africa's energy came from fossil fuels and he urged organisations to move to solar and wind energy.Smith said he hoped this would be viable for Groote Schuur in the future.
