The US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) reports that an average of nine firearms a day were confiscated at the nation's airports last year - most of them loaded.The agency found 3,391 guns on travellers, 83% of which were ready to fire.Whatever their thoughts on their right to bear arms, we're fairly sure most offenders didn't go through with the "cold, dead hands" part, a reference to the slogan adopted by the National Rifle Association - and famously uttered in 2000 by Charlton Heston. The complete version goes: "I'll give you my gun when you pry it from my cold, dead hands."Gosh, no officer sir. Not you.
