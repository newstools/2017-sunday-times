Job advertisements posted in California suggest that the social network is planning to develop telepathic technology that can read brainwaves - a way of sharing that would go far beyond status updates or sharing holiday snaps.The vacancies at Facebook's "Building 8" division include PhD-level roles for a "brain-computer interface engineer" and a "neural imaging engineer", for a two-year project that will "accomplish bold things". Another advert describes building a "communication and computing platform". Trends for 2017: From no-drill fillings to the rise of robotsThe roles include analysis of "neuro-imaging and electrophysiological data" and "developing novel non-invasive neuro-imaging technologies".The idea of Facebook being able to read minds may sound like science fiction - and potentially the ultimate privacy nightmare. But the job ads are not the first clue that the company wants to make it a reality.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, has described telepathy as the "ultimate communication technology" and a way to capture a feeling "in its perfect form".In 2015, he said: "One day, I believe we'll be able to send full, rich thoughts to each other directly using technology. You'll just be able to think of something and your friends will immediately be able to experience it too."Last year he said that the world would move beyond virtual reality and rather than "just being able to capture what's going on in a scene, I think you're going to be able to capture a thought, what you're thinking or feeling, in its kind of ideal and perfect form in your head and be able to share that with the world".He added: "Of course it's really important that people have the power to do this in the way that they want, to be able to share that with other people."While Zuckerberg has said that such technology was decades away, the job ads suggest Facebook is willing to lead the way.Researchers have already made breakthroughs in decoding brainwaves. Scientists at the University of Washington showed they could detect if a subject was looking at a photograph of a face or of a house.
