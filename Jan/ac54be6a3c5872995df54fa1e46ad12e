Owned by the German BMW Group, Mini s line-up will continue to get bigger, as highlighted by the second-generation Countryman due early in 2017.With its smallest car nearly twice the weight of the original 617kg Mini and 767mm longer, the Mini name has become a brand, rather than an ethos.BMW Group director of sales and marketing Ian Robertson says Mini will never build a car smaller than the current three-door Cooper hatch, even if it promised to deliver greater volumes.All hail the 10 most long-lived cars of all time The Mini is not a small car, Robertson said. To go smaller, demand and profitability is the issue. Below that segment (the Cooper three-door), that s huge, huge volume and what do you get out of it? Acknowledging Mini s volumes could leap if a cheaper, smaller car anchored the range, Robertson said that was not an upside for the premium small brand. A lot of the growth around the world is UKL (the BMW Group s small, front-drive architecture that hosts every car in the Mini family, along with the BMW X1 and the 2-Series Active Tourer) and small models. Do you go after profitability further up the range or small volume? That s the trade. Ironically, environmental concerns and the forthcoming European 95g limit for a car company s fleet CO2 emissions are other reasons why BMW is shying away from a smaller Mini. In the past, smaller models gave you higher compensation for CO2, but it s not like that anymore now that we have plug-in hybrid systems in the big cars. But if you put a plug-in hybrid feature down there (in a mini Mini) you have a price imbalance you can t recover.
