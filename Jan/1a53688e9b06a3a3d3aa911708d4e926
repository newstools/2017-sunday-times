Serve immediately.HOW TO MAKE SCRAMBLED EGGSThe best scrambled eggs I have ever eaten were prepared by food writer Jill Dupleix. Her method is to beat 3-4 eggs, melt a knob of butter in a pan over low heat, add eggs and 15ml (1 tbsp) milk and stir gently with a wooden spoon until just thickening. Her secret is to whisk in 45ml (3 tbsp) fresh cream and cook eggs till just scrambled. Remove from heat, season to taste and serve.Mushroom cap eggsHOW TO BOIL AN EGGPlace eggs in a pan and cover with cold water. Add a pinch of salt and bring to the boil. Boil for 1-2 minutes for soft eggs, 3-4 minutes for medium and 5-8 minutes for hard. When making hard-boiled eggs, remove pan from the heat, pour off water, crack shells lightly and cover eggs with cold water to cool. This prevents the blue ring forming around the yolk.HOW TO MAKE CODDLED EGGSCoddled eggs are gently cooked eggs which have a similar texture to poached eggs. They're individually steamed in ceramic or glass jars with a lid, which are placed in bain-marie (water bath).To make them, place a cloth in the base of a deep pan, butter the sides of the jars and break an egg into each. Add a dash of cream or grated cheese if desired and season. Seal tightly. Stand the jars in the base of pan and fill with water to come up the sides. Bring to the boil and boil for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stand for 5-7 minutes. Serve in the jars.
