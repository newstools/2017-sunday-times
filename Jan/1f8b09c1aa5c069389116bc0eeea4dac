We invited 30 Sunday Times Food readers to act as judges.They were presented with four supermarket house brands of ready-made egg mayonaisse sandwiches - with no branding - on separate plates.To ensure the taste test was fair, auditor Stephanie Pardoe was on hand to monitor the process, from removing the packaging and numbering the samples to the judging. Pardoe also collated the scores.Judges' comments: Described as having a good flavour thanks in part to the addition of chives it was well seasoned. Tasters enjoyed the brown bread, the quality of the bread and the chunkiness of the filling. This was found to be a good example of an egg mayonnaise sandwich.Price: R24Where to buy South Africa's creamiest, cheesiest macaroni cheeseJudges' comments: The tasters picked up that the sandwiches were well buttered and contained a smooth mash of egg and mayonnaise, although they felt the seasoning was lacking. They liked the idea of the brown bread, which was good quality.Price: R25.99Judges' comments: The sandwich looked better than it tasted. The panel found it to be tasteless and the filling dry. It lacked mayonnaise and was under seasoned. They described it as a dull sandwich with bread that was quite doughy and not the freshest. Some tasters felt it was more of an egg and lettuce sandwich.Price: R13.99Judges' comments: The bread was very fresh. The consensus was that filling had a very sharp vinegar taste making it tart and unpalatable. Tasters commented that there was not enough egg to balance this sharp flavour. The filling wasn t smooth and was under seasoned, and the lettuce was soggy. One sample was found to have bits of egg shell in the filling.Price: R12.99
