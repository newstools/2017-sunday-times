The dystopian novel featuring a "ministry of truth" that distorts reality was the No1 seller on Amazon's US book list this week.Sales of the book have been increasing amid comments by President Donald Trump and his aides that appear to fly in the face of the facts, including one justifying the use of "alternative facts".CNN, among the first outlets to report the jump in sales of the Orwell book, said publishing house Penguin Books had ordered an unusually large reprint of 75,000 copies to meet unexpected demand.The novel, released in 1949, introduced the term "doublethink", which, according to Orwell, "means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them".In the book, an all-powerful state attempts to control people's thoughts and suppress any dissenting views.Psychologist and author Marilyn Wedge said in a blog post that she saw parallels with the current state of affairs."Donald Trump is attempting to twist the norms of our democracy to his own will," she said."He is trying to tell us to believe what he and his advisers say, rather than what our eyes tell us."The Orwell book is not the only dystopian novel to get renewed interest. On Amazon's list, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World was No31 and Sinclair Lewis's It Can't Happen Here No36.
