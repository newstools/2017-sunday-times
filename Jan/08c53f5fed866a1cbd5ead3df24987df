Prominent businessmen and other VIPs seeking an intimate audience with the president had to cough up R2-million for their three-member delegations to secure space at Zuma's table at the ANC's gala dinner in Sandton last night, as part of its 105th birthday bash.The ANC charged higher than usual prices for sharing a meal and hobnobbing with Zuma and other party bigwigs amid speculation that the party's financial books are in the red.The R2-million "official partner sponsorship package" secured three seats at Zuma's table, six seats at another table, golf balls for eight players at a golf day and VIP accreditation for the ANC rally at Orlando Stadium, Soweto, today.Details of the sponsorship packages for the ANC fundraising gala dinner were contained in a letter circulated by treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize in which he invites business people to book seats.
