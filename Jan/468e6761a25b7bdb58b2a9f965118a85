The latest and largest sleep study, conducted in the US using consumer data from 1.53million nights of sleep, showed that about 80% of adults get less than the minimum requirement of seven hours of sleep per night.South Africans are no exception.Neurologist Dr Kevin Rosman, a specialist in sleep medicine for the past 20 years, said the most common sleep disorders he treated were chronic insomnia and obstructive sleep apnoea, when breathing repeatedly stops and starts as you sleep.Late-night social media use could be affecting your teen's happiness: studyWhile the reasons range from psychological to chronic medical conditions, studies have shown that sleeping as little as an hour less than recommended doubles the risk of a motor accident.Daniel Rabinowitz, a clinical psychologist in Cape Town, said: "Sleep disorders cause more than just daytime sleepiness. If sleep problems are a regular occurrence and interfere with your daily life, you may have a sleep disorder. They can take a serious toll on your mental and physical health, leading to memory problems, high blood pressure, weight gain - and impacting on your immune system, heart health, energy levels, and mood."A lack of sleep can exacerbate existing conditions.Rosman said women with young babies were prone to postnatal depression as a result of the associated massive hormonal changes."In addition, the interruption of sleep can cause depression. Depression is also frequently seen in conditions such as obstructive sleep apnoea, where the sleep may be interrupted 100 times an hour."Rosman said in recent years electronic devices had contributed to poor sleep. "The first way they are detrimental is simply because of the arousal effect. If one is completely engrossed in whatever one is doing with them, devices could wake us up rather than calm us down."The second way devices affect us is the background of blue light. When we are exposed to a certain intensity of blue light in the morning, this suppresses the production of melatonin, the sleep hormone."When light dims at the end of the day, melatonin production increases, and that puts us to sleep a few hours later. If melatonin production is suppressed in the evening, this is likely to worsen insomnia," Rosman said.Will catching more sleep help you avoid catching a cold?This is why he does not recommend using electronic devices to fix sleep disorders.Caffeine, alcohol and exercising too late in the day result in poor sleep, although mild exercise, like yoga or stretching, does help to get you to sleep well.There are more than 80 different sleep disorders and Rabinowitz said medication was only useful in the short term."Rather, cognitive behavioural therapy is an effective intervention. The therapist helps you to look at concerns about how you sleep and what to do when you can't sleep."Rosman suggests the "optimal sleep environment" starts with a comfortable bed."The room should be dark and quiet enough, cool enough [15 C to 20 C], and secure enough. We tend to sleep better at a slightly lower temperature, although women like the temperature to be slightly higher than men, on average."Generally speaking, the less sound the better. A complete absence of sound is better for sleep than even the most relaxing music."Don't feel guilty about taking that nap after lunch - scientists say it boosts your mental abilities, especially if you are getting on in years.A study among about 3,000 Chinese people 65 and older has found that a nap generally led to better memory and thinking skills, and that one hour was the optimum duration.Study co-author Junxin Li, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said an afternoon nap of around 20 minutes could improve alertness and mental performance in all adults, without interfering with night-time sleep.Study participants did better at mathematical tests, word recall and figure drawing after napping.The study was published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society
