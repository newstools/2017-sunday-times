The 28-year-old missed last weekend's win at Leicester City with a back injury following reports of a bust-up with Conte and his coaching staff. The fallout also came after a Chinese Super League club had been reportedly linked with the Brazil-born Spain international.Conte said: "Yes. He's available for the game against Hull City. He restarted having training sessions on Tuesday with the rest of the team. Reds' title ambitions suffer a major blow"I think the player wants to stay at Chelsea. He's very happy to play with us. This idea [to move] is far from his mind."Conte refused to directly address questions over the reported argument and would not confirm if he met with Costa individually this week.And the Italian insisted Costa trained on his own on Sunday and Monday, while his teammates had time off, to be in the right physical condition to rejoin first-team training on Tuesday.Conte said: "After the game against Leicester I told you the truth and I repeat: I heard a lot of speculation about Diego."But now the most important thing is he trained with us this week and the most important thing is he hasn't pain in his back."He's available to come back in our squad against Hull City."Conte did confirm Chelsea are considering an offer from Bournemouth for second-choice goalkeeper Asmir Begovic, back-up to Thibaut Courtois.Conte said: "There is this offer. The club and I are evaluating this offer."Meanwhile, fourth-placed Arsenal - eight points behind Chelsea - have no margin for error when they entertain Burnley today.They are one of many clubs to have long been linked with a move for West Ham's want-away star Dimitri Payet, but they have now moved to sign him.Payet is desperate to leave the London Stadium after deciding he has outgrown the club, having been one of the players of the tournament at Euro 2016 last summer.He agreed a new five-year deal at the club last February, making him the highest-paid player in West Ham's history, earning 125 000 a week, but he is claiming he has a back injury and isn't currently involved with the first team.
