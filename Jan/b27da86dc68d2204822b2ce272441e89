It comes a week after the 75th anniversary of the Wannsee Conference, outside Berlin, where the Third Reich leadership knocked out the administrative details of the Final Solution.There are now more than 16,000 books on the Holocaust and decades of testimony. Over the years, a counter-culture of scepticism, even outright denialism, has emerged."And yet," the historian Nicholas Stargardt wrote in the New York Times recently, "there is something so singular and unimaginable about the events themselves that in this field, unlike many others, historians turn away from metaphor".Stargardt was reviewing two important new books, Final Solution: The Fate of the Jews 1933-1949 (St Martin's Press) by the late David Cesarani and Why? Explaining the Holocaust (WW Norton &amp; Co) by Peter Hayes.Of the two, Stargadt noted, it was the latter that was more circumspect, providing an "intellectually searching" study in modest, didactic form.Cesarani's magnum opus, which connects the Holocaust with the military campaigns of World War 2, is, on the other hand, a masterpiece of "classical realism, as he eschews explicit emotional and moral commentary for the most part, in order not to displace the cumulative impact of his witnesses".Cesarani's moral outrage, Stargardt writes, is, however, never in doubt, as he dispenses with a lingering taboo: almost every atrocity and attack against Jews in eastern Europe was accompanied by rape and sexual violence.
