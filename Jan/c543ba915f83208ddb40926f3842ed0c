I wish only the best for this new little baby and happiness in his family."With that said, I have a side of this story to tell and it's important that I say it. The nightmare leading up to Christmas began at the end of November. I was thrown into prison, albeit for only a few hours."Deane said she had had to appear in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court after her spousal visa had expired."I applied well in advance for the renewal, but the administrative process overran the expiry date by eight days ... As a result I have not been able to leave the country ... with the threat of a criminal record and deportation hanging over my head."She said the matter would be back in court later this month.Smith, through his attorney Marlaine Wiehahn, said he had not known about Deane's detention. "This is the first that Graeme has heard of [it]," Wiehahn said.She said Smith had paid for Deane to get legal help in renewing her visa. "Morgan elected not to follow her attorney's advice, leading to further legal costs for which Graeme was not prepared to pay."Home affairs spokesman Mayihlome Tshwete said Deane had spent a brief period in jail because she had overstayed her visa and had not provided "good cause" for the delay in getting it renewed.In an excerpt from her book, Deane says she was "disempowered" by a powerful man, and her "beautiful house" became her prison."The walls were cemented with heartbreak and glossed with tears," she writes.govendersu@sundaytimes.co.za
