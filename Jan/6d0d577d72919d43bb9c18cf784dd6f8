Torpedo Swim Run 2017 is a team event based on the overseas SwimRun format.The event is focused on exploring the coastline and having fun whilst participating in various swim and run activities.On the swim legs of the event participants swim in wetsuits, using hand paddles and flotation devices. The wetsuits and running shoes are also kept on for the duration of the event as there are no transition zones; you simply get out of the water and run until the next swim leg.</img>Happy to be home - arriving on Clifton 4th beach.
