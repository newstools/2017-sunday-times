That's the warning from health researchers who say South Africa is the second-weakest of 21 nations tested - and they have discovered a direct link between a population's strength and its Olympic medal tally.Only Pakistanis have weaker muscles than South Africans when hand grip is used as a measure of strength, according to data studied by scientists in Canada and the UK.Van Niekerk, with his world record-shattering 400m run, and Semenya, who won the 800m gold six days later last August, were among only 10 South African medal winners in Rio. Pros and cons of SA players heading to Europe In the previous four Olympics - in London, Beijing, Athens and Sydney - we won only 18 medals, for a five-games tally of 28.The two strongest nations in the scientists' study - Sweden and Poland - won 43 and 55 medals respectively, even though their populations are significantly smaller than South Africa's.Pakistan, where the average grip strength is half that in Sweden and Poland, has won no Olympic medals despite having a population of more than 190 million."There was a significant positive association between national population grip strength and medal tally that persisted after adjustment for sex, age, height, average daily caloric intake and GDP," said the scientists, writing in the journal PLOS One.They admitted that many other factors contributed to Olympic success, including sending more athletes, spending more on health, social development, and even culture and politics.But grip strength had been found to "act as a proxy for a range of other physiological characteristics".They added: "Our analysis raises a fascinating hypothesis that a large part of a nation's success at a summer Olympic Games is determined by the strength of its entire population, and that the representative athlete is a reflection of this population characteristic."The findings should not detract from the feats of individual athletes such as Van Niekerk, Semenya, and South Africa's other Rio medallists - Cameron van der Burgh and Chad le Clos (swimming), Lawrence Brittain and Shaun Keeling (rowing), Luvo Manyonga (long jump), Sunette Viljoen (javelin), Henri Schoeman (triathlon) and the Sevens rugby team."These athletes are, nonetheless, born into a socioeconomic and cultural context, with its associated dietary and environmental exposures," they said."Prior to embarking on the training and diet specific to their calling as athletes, they would have been influenced by the food and physical activity environments, as well as healthcare, of their society."Hence, we speculate that favourable environments promote higher population muscle strength."</img>Caster Semenya after winning gold in the women s 800m final.

"These predictive tests tend to work in general but very rarely specifically," he said.The study was based on data gathered in the 21-nation Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology study, which has 152,610 participants.
