THE WORLD'S SMARTEST LITTLE BLACK DRESS At its launch in Manchester, UK, last Wednesday, the world's smartest little black dress lit up the stage. Made from Graphene, a material 200 times stronger than steel and which conducts electricity better than anything else in the world, it used the model's breath to generate the frock's LED lights. The Nobel Prize-winning fabric invented in 2004 by scientists from the University of Manchester, is a million times thinner than human hair.CHIPS!

The team from Stanford University in California has worked with 60 volunteers using wearable devices to collect data on the behaviour of the body. This includes among other things, heart rate, length of sleep and temperature. Over a sustained period of time the researchers found that they could pinpoint a change in the body's functioning before the volunteer became physically aware of the changes. The hope is that the app will be able to trigger warnings for chronic diseases such as diabetes.
