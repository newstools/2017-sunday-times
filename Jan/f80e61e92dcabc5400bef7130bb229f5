In his first meeting with a foreign leader since becoming president, Trump and May both said a new trade deal was in the interests of both nations.She also appeared to secure a number of concessions from the president and said that Trump had told her he was "100% behind" Nato despite his earlier criticism of the body.She also said that the strength of the special relationship meant that she could have "frank discussions" with Trump when she disagreed with him.In a joint news conference May also highlighted her support for sanctions on Russia amid reports Trump wants to see them lifted.The president said the US and UK had "one of the great bonds", highlighting his mother's Scottish roots as one reason that relationship was so important to him. Trade war looms over that wall"A free and independent Britain is a blessing to the world, and our relationship has never been stronger," he said, adding that he looked forward to working with May to strengthen ties.May also revealed that Trump had accepted an invitation from Queen Elizabeth to visit the UK later this year.Trump praised the UK's Brexit vote, saying it would be a "wonderful thing for your country. You are going to have your own identity and the people you want in your country and you are going to be able to make free trade deals."Trump was damning about the EU, referring to it as the "consortium" and the "group" and highlighting his own bad business experiences with the body.May confirmed that she and the president have been holding discussions on a post-Brexit trade deal.May said that Britain and the US are "united in recognition of Nato as the bulwark of collective defence" after Trump's repeated criticisms of the organisation.Ahead of the trip May made clear that the UK would never sanction torture after Trump said he wanted a return of water-boarding and other "enhanced interrogation techniques".However, Trump sought to defuse a potential row by highlighting the fact that his new secretary of defence, James Mattis, opposes torture.He said: "We have a great general who has just been appointed secretary of defence. He has stated publicly he does not believe in water-boarding, torture, enhanced interrogation."I don't necessarily agree but he will override because I am giving him that power."Challenged by the BBC about his views on torture, Russia, banning Muslims and punishment for abortion, Trump joked to May: "This was your choice of a question. There goes that relationship." - The Daily Telegraph, London
