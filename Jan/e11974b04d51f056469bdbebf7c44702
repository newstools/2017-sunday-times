To the Joburg commuter, those wire-artists who set up shop on busy street corners are as much a fixture of our roads as potholes and middle fingers. Except, of course, that they make us happy. Those who pay attention are treated daily to their evolving galleries - lions and Scottie dogs and giraffes, oh my - and, with just bits of wire and some coloured beads, the best of them manage to infuse each of their creations with a wink of realism, sprinklings of fantasy and pinches of personality. Lately, we've noticed a new trend: birds. There are fantasy birds, sure, with colour combos perhaps found only in real life deep in the Amazon jungle, but there are also some marvellous replicas of feathered fellows familiar to our own parks and gardens. We took a look at some of the more distinctive ones, their real-life inspirations, and met the artists who made them.
