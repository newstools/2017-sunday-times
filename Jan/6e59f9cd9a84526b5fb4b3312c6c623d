In elections, social media as a campaign tool has become non-negotiable. However, it has also created a more sinister world where fake news is used to push a candidate, an agenda or a party.Social media lawyer Emma Sadleir said there was no question that fake news had played a role in influencing voter behaviour in the US presidential and Brexit votes."What we saw in South Africa was a pretty failed attempt so it didn't have as much impact." 'Fake' callers part of shady business of attracting votesSadleir said that before the advent of social media, people received news and information from traditional media channels regulated by press codes and media law.But, she said, social media provided wide-ranging access with little accountability, allowing "anyone to have their own agenda".Xolani Dube, a senior researcher at the Xubera Institute Of Research And Development think-tank, said fake news had existed before social media. "During the Cold War it was called propaganda."However, in the current context this propaganda had expanded from politics into all aspects of life.Political analyst Daniel Silke said it was "difficult to quantify the effect of fake news" on the US and Brexit votes, but the rapid sharing of news and its manipulation could have a "cumulative effect on how we process news and information".During the Brexit campaign, fake news sites shared false information indicating that the vote had been extended to a second day.An analysis of pre-US election news by website Buzzfeed found that in the three months leading to the polls, people engaged more with fake news stories on Facebook than traditional ones from 19 major news outlets. If the president of the US is prepared to sanction the false news narrative, this adds to its status and could be emulated by regimes around the world Among the trending fake news stories were that Pope Francis had endorsed Donald Trump and that WikiLeaks had shown that Hillary Clinton had sold arms to Islamic State. A similar analysis of fake news by Buzzfeed found that it had failed to gain as much traction in the UK because this space was taken up by the tabloid press.US journalists uncovered fake news "factories" in Russia and Georgia that churned out pro-Trump content. An investigation ordered by former president Barack Obama uncovered a Russian "influence" campaign which included covert operations as well as social media campaigns, and "trolls" aimed at interfering with the poll.Trump aide Kellyanne Conway recently used the phrase "alternative facts". Silke said: "If the president of the US is prepared to sanction the false news narrative, this adds to its status and could be emulated by regimes around the world."
