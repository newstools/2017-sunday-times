Think smoothies or fruit bars for instance, or any small, on-the-trot food that its maker claims consists of healthy, natural ingredients with added vitamins and nutrients.Late last year global research company Mintel revealed that millennials are more likely than others to snack four or more times a day and, said trend watchers, 35% of meals eaten by millennials could be categorised as snacks.Mintel found that consumers want snacks with ingredients they recognise.The trend seems to be a combination of the need for instant gratification and the need for information.This is a generation with the world at its fingertips - literally.The information age means instant access to friends, news, entertainment, shopping - so why not food?Superfoods are less wholesome than they seemAnd young foodies see themselves as socially responsible individuals who shun preservatives and seek out what they understand to be natural, healthy ingredients.Bruce Dennison, president of the Health Products Association of SA, says: "We're seeing more and more how consumers are leaning on their diets, and not on pharmaceuticals, to prevent disease and optimise their health."A new US study by Amplify Snack Brands and the Centre for Generational Kinetics has found that millennials are the driving force behind the growth of the healthy snack category.The study showed that millennials expect great- tasting snacks with fewer ingredients - 64% of those interviewed said that understanding the ingredients on the packaging increases their level of trust in the snack.Millennials would try a hyper-functional snack based on social media - an online rating for example or a social media post.The favourite snacks of the past century - chocolates, biscuits and soft drinks - are now under pressure.In the developing world sales of these are expected to rise only 2% and will make way for healthier offerings like trail mix, nuts and yoghurt.
