Without going into the actual politics of France's general election on Sunday, I for one cast a superficial fashion vote for seeing much more of Brigitte Trogneux's wardrobe.Brigitte-With-The-Good-Hair is, the wife of president-elect of France Emmanuel Macron and she doesn't play by anyone else's rules.At 64, she's 25 years older than Macron and a grandmother of seven. The former drama coach taught her husband when he was a 15-year-old schoolboy and they got together when he was safely past the spotty stage. Now he's made history, Macron hopes to give her an official role.Tanned, leggy, bombshell blonde and with a cracker of a white smile, the average political wife wardrobe is not for her. She hasn't strapped herself into block-coloured power dresses or pastel suits.You're as likely to see her in a pair of skintight leather trousers and stilettos as a sky-blue pea coat and a flouncy boho scarf. Or a lacey white over-the-knee shift and - scandal - shiny black sheer tights. White dress, black sheer tights?In the first round of the elections she wore a sobre but on-trend grey oversized tailored jacket and skinny black jeans - a classic French Vogue look. In the final stages she continued to keep us guessing, turning up one day in a casual black anorak over a hoodie, another in a cream jacket over a white V-neck T-shirt. I think you call it mood dressing. On the evidence, Trogneux is clearly in a good one. - The Daily Telegraph This article was originally published in The Times.
