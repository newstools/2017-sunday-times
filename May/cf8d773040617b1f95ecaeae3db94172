It should not be an accident of history or a by-the-way phenomenon but the central thrust of a national continental and international drive to address global unemployment inequality and poverty using tourism as a platform. Zikalala also pointed to the strides made in KZN tourism development which include the growth in the number of airlines flying out from King Shaka International to 11 international destinations as well as a boost to the convention and exhibition sector which is projected to generate in the region of R1.1-billion over the next three years.For KwaZulu-Natal to host the Indaba is extremely important said CEO of Tourism KZN Ndabo Khoza. But more important is what happens beyond these three days. We are beginning to reap the benefits from tourism but we need to do more. We need to talk less about the three days and more about the other 362. The MEC later opened the Tourism KZN stand at the Indaba which includes a section for black-owned tourism business enterprises.
