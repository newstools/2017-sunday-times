The prototype named simply "the machine" uses a new approach to computer architecture which the company says can be adapted for a range of Big Data applications, handling tasks at thousands of times the speed of existing devices.The new system is called "memory driven computing" and uses light waves to transmit data instead of electrical impulses travelling over silicon, bypassing an obstacle to boosting computing speeds.Sharad Singhal, who heads machine applications for HPE, said previous efforts "were running into a brick wall into computation" because computing needs are increasing beyond the capacity of existing chips.The project was a bid "to rethink computers from the ground up". This means that instead of a silicon chip at the heart of the computer "we are putting data at the centre".The prototype unveiled contains 160 terabytes of memory, capable of simultaneously working with the contents of about 160million books, a task not previously possible in a single unit.Singhal said supercomputers accomplish this task by stringing together clusters of processors but the new machine can handle this more efficiently in one unit.HPE unveiled its first prototype last year, but has increased the number of computing nodes from two to 40. The company hoped to commercialise the machine within a few years."The secrets to the next great scientific breakthrough, industry-changing innovation, or life-altering technology hide in plain sight behind the mountains of data we create every day," said Meg Whitman, CEO of HP Enterprise.
