Now he's set to perform in front of a crowd of 65,000 at FNB Stadium in Soweto tonight. Oh, and he'll be sharing the stage with global popstar Justin Bieber.For his Purpose World Tour, Bieber picks children from each country to perform on stage with him during his hit song Children.It took Cooper College pupil Julian just two-and-a-half hours to learn the routine before he submitted his YouTube entry to be part of Bieber's show. SA Beliebers pay top dollar for intimate experience "It wasn't actually that hard. The difficult part is keeping the moves precise. It's a very fast routine and the footwork can get complicated with that speed," said Julian , just before his hip-hop dance class at the Ministry of Dance studios in Randburg.He has been dancing for just over two years and specialises in hip-hop and freestyle. One of his dance teachers, Blair Willson, said of her pupil: "There's something special about him. Once he gets on stage he just exudes this confidence. He has so much charisma and is a very dedicated performer."Julian's mother Candice, who will spend the day with him and Bieber's crew as they rehearse for the show, said: "Julian has been so worried about not having time to buy me a Mother's Day present and I had to laugh. I've told him that this is the best present he could possibly give me."So, is the Grade 6 student anxious about the big night?"I'm not nervous about anything. I'm going to go out there and dance my heart out," said Julian.WATCH: Julian Andrews' entry to be part of Justin Bieber's show.
