Liverpool welcome Southampton to Anfield today in a clash that has caused the Reds some problems in the past.Jurgen Klopp's side have played Southampton three times this season, failing to win any of those games. In fact, the Reds have not even scored against The Saints in those three attempts.If there is one thing Reds' supporters have learned, it is that Southampton have proven to be a bogey side for Liverpool. But Klopp's Liverpool will take confidence from the Watford match in their pursuit for a top-four finish. Ajax leave Chippa gasping for breathSouthampton have done well this season, sitting in ninth. They drew last weekend against Hull City in what was quite a dull affair.The Saints have not really got anything to play for as the season is reaching its conclusion, which could potentially play into Liverpool's hands, or it could do the reverse.The goals for Liverpool are not coming as freely as they were at the beginning of the season which has seen the Reds grind out wins at Stoke City, West Brom and Watford of late.The same will have to happen again today. Southampton seem to match up against the Reds well, which has shown in the recent matches they have played each other.Liverpool ultimately need to find a goal and find a way to hold onto it.At this stage, it is not about winning pretty, it is simply about finding a way.There was a scare for Liverpool against Watford when their Brazilian star midfielder Philippe Coutinho was forced off the pitch early, but it was nothing more than a dead leg and one would expect him to be fine for the clash against The Saints.Midfielder Adam Lallana will more than likely replace Divock Origi in the starting XI; the Belgian has failed to make an impact in recent weeks.Lallana was bright in his return from injury off the bench against Watford.
