As we begin the 24th year of hard-earned democracy, the answer would depend on what your ideas, understanding and expectations of it were, and on how you think democracy should work.You would not be the first who struggled to articulate their expectations of democracy. Historically, leaders have also interpreted democracy in different ways.Long ago, US president Abraham Lincoln defined democracy as "government of the people, by the people, and for the people". Citizens' anger can be used to devise a new political agenda Winston Churchill famously said: "Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time".Nelson Mandela said: "Democracy is based on the majority principle. This is especially true in a country such as ours where the vast majority have been systematically denied their rights. At the same time, democracy also requires that the rights of political and other minorities be safeguarded."Franklin D Roosevelt listed six foundations of a healthy and strong democracy: "Equality of opportunity for youth and for others; jobs for those who can work; security for those who need it; the ending of special privilege for the few; the preservation of civil liberties for all; the enjoyment of the fruits of scientific progress in a wider and constantly rising standard of living."Clearly, democratic governance is based on many components.Among them, the UN has listed the following as fundamental: separation and maintenance of the balance of power between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary; the independence of the judiciary; protection and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; transparency and accountability in government performance; and media freedom.In each society, including our own, democracy takes on a unique expression, even though the core elements of regular elections, civic and human rights protections, and the alternation of power among factions or parties remain common goals.Indeed, while every nation must find the particular form of democracy that works best for its people, there are necessary elements: freedom of expression and assembly, an inclusive social dialogue, effective checks and balances and respect for the rule of law.Of course, "freedom" and "democracy" are often used interchangeably, but the two are not synonymous. Democracy is indeed a set of ideas and principles about freedom, but it also consists of practices and procedures that have been moulded through a long, often tortuous history. Democracy is the institutionalisation of freedom.In fact, democracy can be, and has been, the engine of freedom's destruction, as we have seen in totalitarian regimes masquerading as democracies.It's up to all of us to leave the next generations a land of peace Democracy, however it is implemented, literally means that the people rule. But what does that mean?The writings of French political philosopher Benjamin Constant, who died in 1830, are helpful in untangling this.He said there were two notions of liberty: one ancient, one modern.He argued that the ancient notion held that liberty and freedom lay in the right to participate in the democratic process, to cast one's vote.In the collectivist version of liberty or freedom, as citizens of the country, we freely carry out our will. Our freedoms may not thwart the will of others.In contrast, Constant wrote, the modern notion of liberty and freedom is individualistic. It denotes the right to conduct one's own affairs. Participation in the political process is one rather minor aspect of this liberty and freedom.Maybe that is the reason some people prefer to stay at home on election day.Unfortunately, in our democracy politicians have a virtual free hand, leaving large groups of our citizens vulnerable, thus making democracy the enemy of freedom.This is a long-recognised problem. As Aristotle wrote, "Where laws are not sovereign ... since the many are sovereign not as individuals but collectively ... such a democracy is not a constitution at all."Considering the above analysis, what is going wrong in South Africa in the pursuit of this very noble cause called democracy?Regardless of what Lincoln said about it being government of the people, for the people and by the people, its piecemeal and ill-prepared implementation is leading to service-delivery protests, disruptions of parliamentary proceedings and mass protests.Why?Because the spoils of democracy, particularly economic freedom, are not being experienced by many, hence the three devils of inequality, poverty and unemployment remain rampant.South Africa has not been able to reap the democracy dividend inherent in transparency, stability and accountability and thereby achieve sustainable economic growth, more balanced distribution of wealth, elimination of poverty and better access to justice. Editorial: Judges have served us, and our democracy, wellTherefore, we should resist believing that democracy is a universal panacea for all our ills, that it will provide everything we want in terms of good government, the right kind of values and the right kind of moral and social order.So how can we make sure that democracy delivers, that all of our people benefit from the freedom, the opportunity, and the access that this system of government should afford?Democracy has never been easy to create. It takes time to gel. The road to democracy often is not easy. There are no short cuts. This is a tremendous challenge, perhaps a never-ending one.We need to forge a new consensus on democracy that delivers. It has to be based on political will, leadership, and a common commitment to action on behalf of all.What we need is action and the political will to move forward in ways we can all see and measure, through the difficult economic, political and social circumstances that we all face, to create democratic institutions that work, that have credibility, that promote sustainable growth, and that tackle corruption, greed, waste and abuse of power.We need rigorous civic engagement, inclusive, transparent and effective mechanisms and institutions, mutual trust, a sense of collective responsibility and the courage to work for the common good.Let us ever be mindful that ultimately our democracy should deliver more benefits to the people, if the people are to continue believing in it.
