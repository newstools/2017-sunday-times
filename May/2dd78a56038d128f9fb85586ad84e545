The Sunday Times has it on good authority that Gigaba summoned Denel board chairman Dan Mantsha to Durban on Friday to express his concern about the financial implications of the deal for the National Treasury.Gigaba - who has admitted to visiting the Guptas and attending their Diwali celebrations - also instructed Mantsha to withdraw Denel's high court application against the Treasury. Denel challenged former finance minister Pravin Gordhan's refusal to approve the company's joint venture with VR Laser Asia to form a new company called Denel Asia. Guptas go on the offensiveSources claim that Gigaba was hard on Mantsha and instructed him to deregister Denel Asia and dissolve the joint venture with VR Laser Asia.When approached for comment on Friday, Mantsha confirmed that Gigaba had summoned him to Durban on Friday morning. "I can confirm the meeting with the minister, but I can't comment about its details," he said.Mantsha referred further questions to Denel acting CEO Zwelakhe Ntshepe. However, Ntshepe said yesterday that Mantsha had not yet briefed him on the meeting with Gigaba.The minister's spokesman, Mayihlome Tshwete, yesterday also confirmed Gigaba's meeting with Mantsha."The minister raised a concern with the board chairperson that the joint venture didn't make business sense to the National Treasury, and the other matter of serious concern is the financial implications of the deal to the National Treasury," he said.Defending the controversial deal in high court papers filed in March, Ntshepe claimed that Denel Asia was formed to seek new business opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region, where defence budgets were increasing.He accused the Treasury of delaying the approval of the joint venture, which Denel believed would help it "find new markets for our world-class products, especially in the fields of artillery, armoured vehicles, missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles".Gupta business associate Salim Essa is the sole shareholder of VR Laser Asia.He is also a director of VR Laser RSA, a company owned by President Jacob Zuma's son Duduzane, and Rajesh Gupta, through an entity called Westdawn Investments.Ajay Gupta's son, Kamal Kant Singhala, was a director of VR Laser RSA but has resigned.The Guptas were said to be set to make billions from this deal.City Press reported last April that VR Laser had got a share of a R10-billion contract for 238 Badger vehicles, called Project Hoefyster, from Denel in November 2013. Denel goes to court over Gupta-linked dealVR Laser was responsible for the steel cutting in the contract but not the manufacturing of the vehicles.Before signing off the joint venture with VR Laser Asia, Denel had hired law firm ENSafrica to compile a due diligence report on the company and it was advised to avoid the deal at all costs, or at least be cautious of it, because the entity was linked to "politically exposed persons".The ENSafrica report said: "We identified adverse media relating to VR Laser RSA and reported links to the controversial Rajesh Gupta and to Duduzane Zuma."Essa was also "politically exposed", the report added."Essa is flagged as a politically exposed person."The report further mentioned that a major in the US army had confessed to "illegally exporting firearms to an employee of VR Laser RSA from 2008 to 2012".At the time, the major was a registered firearms dealer.The report added that the major "pleaded guilty to receiving unlawful payment and illegally shipping firearms to South Africa, facing a maximum of 25 years in prison and a fine of up to $1.25-million".
