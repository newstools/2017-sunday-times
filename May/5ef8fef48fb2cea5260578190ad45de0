Victory in Stockholm would secure qualification for the Champions League, but the cost of missing out for a second successive season was laid bare this week and underlined the pressure on Jose Mourinho to deliver the 25th trophy of his managerial career.United have revised their revenue forecast for this season and now expect to post an increased turnover for 2016-17 of between 560million and 570million, up 30million from September s estimates, thanks largely to success in the Europa League. Drama in the English Premier League is far from overBut while United expect to generate revenue of up to 20million from the Europa League, mainly because of an extra 8million windfall on the back of their Premier League rivals failures in the competition, that is 60% less than the 50million the club anticipate they would earn from the Champions League.In addition, United would also suffer a 30% reduction in the value of their 10-year kit deal with Adidas the equivalent of 21million if they fail to qualify for the Champions League for a second season running.If they do not qualify for the Champions League, United s revenue would be partially offset by a reduction in the salaries and bonuses the club would have to pay players.Meanwhile, Mourinho praised Paul Pogba for his response to his father s death as he prepared to recall him for Manchester United s final Premier League game of the campaign today.Mourinho has promised to make sweeping changes for the fixture against Crystal Palace, ahead of their final date with Ajax.But the United manager has confirmed the world s most expensive footballer will be in the line-up despite his father s death this week. Paul Pogba is fine, Mourinho said. A strong guy, strong mentality. He s learning how to live after his father passed away, but he is strong. He knows that he needs to play on Sunday because he hasn t played or trained for a long time and he needs these minutes on the pitch, so he plays against Palace.
