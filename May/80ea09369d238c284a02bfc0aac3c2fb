Silva, 22, the Portuguese playmaker, is expected to be the first of at least six new arrivals at the club as Guardiola reacts to a disappointing debut season in England.Leftback Benjamin Mendy, Silva's teammate at Monaco, and Tottenham rightback Kyle Walker are also in Guardiola's sights, in addition to Leonardo Bonucci, the Juventus centre-half, and Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez.Guardiola is also chasing a new goalkeeper as backup for Claudio Bravo. Among those who are likely to be approached are Leicester City's Kasper Schmeichel, Ederson Moraes of Benfica and Gianluigi Donnarumma at AC Milan.City are understood to have paid a flat fee with no add-ons for Silva, who was instrumental in Monaco's march to the French league title this season as well as their progress to the European Champions League semifinals. He will officially join City on July 1.Silva attracted interest from a host of leading European clubs but said the opportunity to work with Guardiola was too good to turn down."If not the best coach in the world, he is one of the best," Silva said. "Of course when you have the opportunity of being trained by Guardiola, you don't say no. As we all know, what he did in Barcelona and Bayern Munich was amazing, and we expect also here that he will win titles. To be honest I'm now at one of the best teams in the world. To be part of this club and to have this opportunity is great."City are already well stocked in the attacking midfield positions and Silva will face fierce competition from his Spaniard namesake David Silva and Belgian Kevin de Bruyne. He is also seen as a natural successor to David Silva in what Guardiola believes is an ageing squad.
