The Sunday Times reported last week that eyebrows were being raised about the party, hosted recently at the lavish One&amp;Only hotel in the Mother City.At least one self-described contractor for Madikizela's department of human settlements has said she helped pay for the party. Phumla Zantsi, a partner at Lawula Trading and Construction, confirmed contributing R3,000.This week, Western Cape premier Helen Zille instituted an inquiry into the financing of the party. On Friday, she said the initial investigation was progressing well and should be concluded this weekend."I am gathering all the facts before determining what form of further investigation or action may be necessary from the provincial government's side."The case has already been reported to the public protector, so I presume there is that investigation under way. But before I or the provincial government take any further action, or make any statements, we must apprise ourselves fully of the facts," said Zille.She confirmed that the investigation was probing how the party was financed.Asked whether the probe dealt with who attended the party, Zille said: "Attendance at the party is not the issue here. Anyone can be invited to attend a party without knowing or asking how it was financed."However, working from photographs from the party, in which contractors can be identified, I have followed up with them too."Yesterday, Madikizela said he welcomed the premier's inquiry and was co-operating.
