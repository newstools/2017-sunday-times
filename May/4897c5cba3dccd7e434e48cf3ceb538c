This year's exhibition explores the work of Rei Kawakubo, who founded the Comme des Gar ons fashion label. With a veritable parade of haute-couture creations, this latest edition of the Met Ball didn't disappoint, bringing sumptuous and sometimes outlandish or eccentric ensembles to the red carpet.This year's trends encompassed glamor and sensual, sexy styles, with glitter and sequins, see-through fabrics, plunging necklines and sky-high splits, as well as long, flowing trains. These themes were channeled by the likes of Gisele B ndchen, Adriana Lima, Nicki Minaj (pictured above), Halle Berry and Kendall Jenner.How to add Gucci flair to any outfit (no matter the cost!)Others went for more subtle looks, in black and/or white, with chic ensembles, sometimes with masculine inspirations. This was the look of choice for Claire Danes, Paris Jackson, Karlie Kloss and a certain Kim Kardashian. Prizes for originality, or perhaps eccentricity, go to Katy Perry, who wore an impressive red tulle gown by John Galliano for Maison Margiela, and to Rihanna, veritable star of the Gala, who graced the red carpet in a colorful 3D creation from Comme des Gar ons.H&M's highly-anticipated new Conscious Exclusive collection hits Cape Town
