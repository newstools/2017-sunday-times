I moved to an office in Woodstock, Cape Town, a year ago. Some evenings after work I walk the streets, using a camera as an excuse to meet people. It's an open community and I feel welcome.The streets are the back yards, garages, sports fields and meeting places of the people who live here; sometimes they are kitchens and bedrooms.I spend most of my time on Gympie Street. It's a stone's throw from the hubs of caf culture and cool, but stubbornly resists the creep of gentrification.It was once known for drug dens and gangs, but the most dominant gang I know is the Watermelon Gang.Armed with juicy pink fruit by a neighbour, Allawieyah, on bright summer evenings the gang takes over the street. Lines are drawn on the tarmac, a football materialises and the game is on. Cars just have to wait.As urban as the environment is, there's still room for pets. Some are vicious beasts tugging at chains, others are a girl's best friend.As evening descends, the dogs settle and watermelon husks are discarded. Some people tuck in for the night, others go to work. If the street light is working, lines are drawn on the pavement and the cricket bat comes out. Once again, the Watermelon Gang owns the street.</img>'Girl's best friend'. Image: Anton Crone 'Girl's best friend'. Image: Anton Crone </img>'Kiss'. Image: Anton Crone 'Kiss'. Image: Anton Crone
