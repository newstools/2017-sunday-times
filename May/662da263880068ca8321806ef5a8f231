Simbine converted his early season form into international defeat for stars Justin Gatlin, Asafa Powell and Andre De Grasse.American Gatlin and Canadian De Grasse were second and third at the Rio Games last year when Simbine ended fifth, just three-hundredths of a second short of the podium. But in the opening Diamond League meet in Doha on Friday night, Simbine slaughtered them, almost from the starting gun.Simbine, 23, had a slight lead going into the halfway mark, and then he displayed his trademark top-end speed as he put daylight between himself and his rivals. Kipchoge runs fastest marathon on recordRunning into a 1.2-metre-per-second headwind, Simbine was the only athlete to dip below 10 seconds, clocking 9.99sec for his sixth sub-10 effort of the season and the 13th of his career.Jamaican Powell was second in 10.08, with Qatar's Femi Ogunode third in 10.13.Gatlin was fourth in 10.14 and De Grasse fifth in 10.21.Simbine had beaten Powell last year when he set his 9.89 SA record in Hungary, but Friday was the first time he had scalped Gatlin, who had won 36 of 38 100m races in the past three seasons.Gatlin, 35, the 100m Olympic champion at Athens 2004, had been beaten only twice in that period, and by only one man - the unbeatable Usain Bolt, at the 2015 world championships in Beijing and again in Rio last year.Now he was outside the top two for the first time since 2013."He [Akani] was feeling sick in the afternoon," coach Werner Prinsloo said yesterday. "He was a little fluish and his stomach was upset. He wasn't physically 100%."Simbine, the first SA sprinter to make an Olympic final since 1932, is on track to become the first countryman to win a 100m world championship medal at the London showpiece in August.Prinsloo said his charge would focus on recovery for the next two weeks. Usain Bolt fears 'belly', but rules out U-turnHe will compete at a sponsor's meet in Paris next Sunday, and after that he would have just three more races in June and July before the world championships.In the women's 800m, Olympic champion Caster Semenya powered over the final 200m to fend off Kenya's bronze medallist from Rio, Margaret Wambui.Semenya won in 1min 56.61sec, a world lead that also eclipsed the 1:56.94 meet record set by Pamela Jelimo, also of Kenya, in 2012.World 1,500m champion Genzebe Dibaba of Ethiopia was fifth in her maiden outdoors 800m.With two wins on the night, South Africa was the second-best performing nation in the track events, behind Kenya with three victories.Jamaica, the US and Bahamas had to settle for one apiece.The Doha home crowd got to enjoy victory in the men's 400m hurdles, courtesy of Abderrahaman Samba, who is coached by South African Hennie Kotze.The Qatari won in 48.44, with LJ van Zyl third in 49.49 and Commonwealth Games champion Cornel Fredericks, still seeking his form from 2014, fifth in 49.96.
