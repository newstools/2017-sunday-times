The official sneak peek into the penultimate season's events begins with Cersei Lannister adamantly telling her brother/lover Jaime that while enemies surround them on all sides, "whatever stands in our way, we will defeat it".The clip continues with glimpses of dragon queen Daenerys' army of the Unsullied and the Dothraki going to battle with Lannister soldiers, while Arya Stark appears to have found her way to the North, where Jon Snow and Sansa rule over Winterfell (via Variety).The most chilling revelation, however, comes from Davos Seaworth, who warns that if they don't unite to defeat the Night King, "it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne".The teaser ends with Jon Snow's voice proclaiming that: "The great war is here."The new season will debut on July 16.
