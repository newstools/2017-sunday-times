But he counts as priceless handwritten notes, personal video foot-age, voice messages and the hat that the King of Pop wore in his famous Smooth Criminal music video.Fiddes - who has been bodyguard to Britney Spears, the Bee Gees, Sting, Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando - laid bare the highs and lows of being part of Jackson's "inner circle" during a visit to Johannesburg this week with his South African wife Moniqe.He never charged Jackson a bodyguard's fee or signed a confidentiality clause because the superstar regarded him as a brother.His ties to South Africa are through his wife, whom he met and married in 2012 during a visit here.Fiddes met Jackson at mutual friend Uri Geller's UK mansion around 1998 and became the pop star's bodyguard and minder until his last days in 2009."One morning Uri called me at three and said I had to come to his house right away, or I would regret it for the rest of my life."Although Fiddes, who was running his martial arts school at the time, lived three hours away, he drove to Geller's home."When I turned up he introduced me to Michael Jackson in his living room. They were super close friends and Michael was a martial arts fanatic and knew all about me."Fiddes was astonished when Jackson walked up to him and bowed like a martial arts student would do to an instructor. It was the beginning of their bond.Imprinted in Fiddes's memory is the Berlin hotel incident in 2002."I remember Michael had just shown the two eldest kids to the screaming crowd below from the [hotel] balcony in Berlin."Sadly we had a doctor with us who I don't believe was good for Michael."I believe he gave Michael something which made him as high as a kite as he was nervous."He got carried away ... When Michael walked back into the room we did not know this was going to be worldwide news."Jackson dangled his nine-month-old son, Prince Michael II, over the balcony railing at the Hotel Adlon, where the family were staying.Jackson later apologised, saying he would never endanger his children's lives. Prince Michael II, also known as Blanket, was also the centre of a legal battle involving Fiddes.In 2002 Fiddes wanted to prove he was the boy's biological father. Fiddes claimed that he had donated sperm in 2001 that had been used. He said Jackson had wanted an athletic child.Asked about the claim, Fiddes said this week: "I have an agreement with Michael's mother, Katherine, that I do not discuss his children now they are in adulthood and can read everything and get bullied."I'm sure you remember Paris [Jackson's daughter] tried to kill herself a few years ago. I am kept aware of how the children are doing via other bodyguards, a few family members and friends."Jackson was a recluse who hated how he looked, said Fiddes.He recalled finding Jackson crying once. The pop star told him he just wanted to be successful - and normal.Jackson told Fiddes he was the loneliest man in the world and wished he had had a choice about being famous."He did not eat much and was very lonely. He didn't have many friends. His life was not glamorous and we just could not go out."Going out for Michael was like working, with all the pictures, requests for autographs and paparazzi chasing us."Behind closed doors, Jackson was a wine-loving ideas man who despised his appearance and loved his children dearly."He wanted his life to be the biggest show on earth and we had to work with him to keep the mystery alive and the media interested."Fiddes dismissed the allegations of child molestation as a "load of rubbish".He said Jackson liked women and had engaged in a few meaningful relationships in secret.Fiddes often allowed his own children to go shopping with Jackson.He said Jackson's dream had been to be knighted for his musical achievements.He also spoke of his "very bad" relationship with his brothers and believed they had used him as their personal bank account."A couple of his brothers used to beg me to try and get them [together] with Michael, but he was not interested. His mother would visit every few months."The last time Fiddes saw Jackson was after the pop star had announced his This Is It tour, which he had planned as his comeback. The singer died soon afterwards in his Beverly Hills mansion.Jackson, said Fiddes, had feared for his life."He was a great guy and I miss him," said Fiddes.
