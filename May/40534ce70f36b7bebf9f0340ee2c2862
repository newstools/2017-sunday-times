Teresa was dead, but Marli showed signs of life.As he and a colleague moved her away from next to her mother's body, blood "flowed like a waterfall to the bottom of the stairs", he said.In the public gallery, members of the Van Breda family and others bowed their heads as harrowing photographs were handled in court.The next day, Andre van Breda, Martin's brother, described a loving, close-knit family, polite children, and a proud father who was an astute businessman with "no enemies to speak of".He said: "Martin sent Teresa on a fish-food course. Martin and I were the test rabbits and I must tell you the food was divine."As his uncle spoke, Henri's expression - normally sullen and poker-faced - clouded with emotion for the first time.Domestic worker Precious Munyongani took the stand, saying the axe found at the crime scene and presented in court looked like the one kept in the scullery.Henri's ex-girlfriend, Bianca van der Westhuizen, said her phone was on aeroplane mode when Henri had tried to call her on the night of the murders. Unable to hold back tears, she said on the day of the murders they had gone to the beach together after school.She said Henri "admired his brother Rudi" but was "closest to his sister Marli".The next day, it was Marli's ex-boyfriend James Reade-Jahn's turn. He was asked by Henri's lawyers to read out a WhatsApp message he had sent to Marli about two weeks before the murders.WATCH: Top 8 talking points from the van Breda triple axe murder trial van breda "I know I told you everything I always feel or am doing, and right now, I feel like I want to murder the people that are around you at the moment and I am inches away from losing it with them and breaking down completely but I am being strong to help you," Reade-Jahn read, his cheeks red."I wasn't thinking," he told the court.
