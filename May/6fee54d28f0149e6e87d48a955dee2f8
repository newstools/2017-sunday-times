Three points separate Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal, with each hoping to join champions Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur in next season's premier European club competition. A Europa League place awaits whoever finishes fifth.City travel to Watford knowing a win would guarantee them third spot and automatic qualification. Should fourth-placed Liverpool beat Middlesbrough, they would at least secure entry into the Champions League qualifying round. Antonio Conte has worked miracles this seasonBut if either team fail to win, and Arsenal beat Everton, a play-off on a neutral ground could yet decide positions because goal difference and goals scored the deciding factors if teams finish level are very tight.City (75 points, 36 goal difference, 75 goals scored) have the edge over Liverpool (73, 33, 75) and Arsenal (72, 31, 74). Put simply, Liverpool must equal Arsenal's result and could even afford to lose to Middlesbrough by a single goal and still finish fourth if the Gunners draw.Manager Arsene Wenger knows a finish outside the top four for the first time under his stewardship is now likely.Wenger will hope Liverpool's extraordinary habit of slipping up against the league's worst teams resurfaces, though relegated Boro have not won away since August and have lost six of their past seven games on the road.For Liverpool to clinch a top-four spot ahead of Arsenal and Manchester United, who heavily outspent them in the transfer market, would be a significant achievement and last week's vibrant 4-0 win over West Ham United suggests Wenger should not hold his breath even if Anfield has witnessed several dismal home performances this season.City, too, have impressed lately with three successive victories and should see off Watford, who have been slip-sliding into the summer break and are parting with manager Walter Mazzarri. For City boss Pep Guardiola, third is the minimum from a campaign in which the pre-season favourites have only impressed in patches.
