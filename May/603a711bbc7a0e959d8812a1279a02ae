What he really wants, if the good people at the Antiques Fair at Nelson Mandela Square in Joburg are to be believed, is for you to find bric-a-brac that will tickle his nostalgia bone. More than 60 dealers will display their wares.The beauty of antiques as a Father's Day gift is that vintage is the new cool and we're all aware that dads need cool points. Where better to rack them up than at a fair that offers original Zippo lighters, classic watches and snazzy hip flasks? If your padre is a little long in the tooth you can find him military antiques, intricately crafted canes and swords.Should the present find itself neglected in a corner of the garage, you can always resell it at what could be a profit - unlike the latest Swiss Army flashlight that will be used twice before being left in some box marked "Dad's old stuff". The fair take place on Sunday June 4 on the upper and lower levels of Nelson Mandela Square, Sandton, Joburg rom 9am. This article was originally published in The Times.
