The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) missed an April deadline for announcing a team, and will hold a special meeting today to discuss a potential withdrawal from the 50-over international tournament.But the powerful BCCI is facing mounting criticism over its stalling tactics, which stem from a dispute with cricket's global governing body over revenue sharing.Last month, the International Cricket Council (ICC) received a thumping mandate from its members to amend rules around revenue so that less money and power is held by cricket's "Big Three" - Australia, England and India.India opposed the changes from the outset and has been hinting at withdrawing from the ICC Champions Trophy in protest."We are, of course, unhappy with what India is getting in the latest revenue sharing plan, but to be honest a pull-out was always our last option," a BCCI official said.
