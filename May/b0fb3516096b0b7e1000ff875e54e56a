Over the 90 years of its operation, from its establishment by the Paul Kruger government in 1893 to its eventual closure in 1983, thousands of prisoners passed through the prison complex on the hill above Empire Road, Johannesburg, from Mahatma Gandhi to members of the Ossewabrandwag, and later anti-apartheid stalwarts such as Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, Lilian Ngoyi, Joe and Ruth Slovo and Barbara Hogan.The No4 section was built for black male prisoners and was notorious for some of the worst atrocities, deaths by torture and disease in the Old Fort's history."This place gets locked up at night and there's no one here," says Strydom.'My art career truly began after I was shot & paralysed'"The only security guy stands outside in the front - they can't find a guy to stand inside here at night - they say you can hear the footsteps of ghosts walking past, you can hear the screams and shouting. They say that people have tried to sleep here overnight and no one's ever made it."Intrigued by the history of the space and a feeling that "there are still a lot of spirits hanging around who are still upset about what happened here", Strydom approached Constitution Hill Exhibitions and archive co-ordinator Gaisang Sathekge to produce a series of photographs, which he hopes will "hint at the anxiety and terror or frustration".With a Hasselblad camera, and by devoting his spare time to "getting used to the space and gradually seeing the not-so-obvious aspects", Strydom has produced a series of close to 30 photographs for an exhibition titled "Hidden Shadows and Silent Voices of Prison No4", which will be shown in several of the cells.Using what he calls "old-school darkroom techniques and C-type prints", Strydom's pictures show aspects of the architecture and objects from the museum to try and convey his sense of what prisoners might have felt as they were kept there, far from their families, in squalid conditions and under constant threat of torture and maltreatment.Strydom says that while growing up during apartheid on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast, he "didn't really know what was going on"."We still haven't been told all these stories and you have to actually go and find them yourself if you want to know. When you hear the stories of what people went through here, I don't know how easily I'd forgive and forget."</img>One of the pictures in the exhibition, 'Two Shoes - Yellow'.
