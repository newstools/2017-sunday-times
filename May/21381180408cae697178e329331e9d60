Mercedes - the previously dominant force in Formula One - together with Ferrari, have been dicing it out for victories in the opening five races. With two wins apiece, Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel are separated by just six points following Hamilton's return to form in Barcelona.He is going for the fabled Monaco hat-trick and back-to-back wins following his triumph last season.Hamilton returned to form with an ominous display in Spain to recover from his uncharacteristic slump in Russia and when he is on top of his game he is very difficult to beat, but Ferrari has a point to prove having lost out on the top step of the podium last time out.Mercedes, boasting just a single victory more than Ferrari, leads the Scuderia by eight points in the constructors' standings after Mercedes' radically updated W08 helped the team gain an edge over Ferrari in Spain.Even against the modified Silver Arrows, Vettel - relatively unhappy with the balance of his car throughout the Spanish Grand Prix weekend - still managed to take second and could well have won had a number of factors fallen his and Ferrari's way.Monaco is a race Mercedes has dominated in recent years, having won the last four grands prix. However, as has been the case in 2017, this year's race is likely to prove to be another tight scrap between Ferrari and Mercedes.Monte Carlo's twisty streets might also open up the chance for Red Bull to close the gap on its rivals, after failing to crack Formula One's new aerodynamic regulations so far this year.Adding to the intrigue is the element of Mercedes' longer wheelbase design and whether it will be a hindrance for the team around the tight Monaco track.Red Bull faces the stark prospect of a winless season - which would mark its first since 2015 and only its second in the last eight years. Daniel Ricciardo was on stellar form in Monaco last year, claiming a stunning maiden pole, only to be denied what looked like certain victory by a pit-stop blunder.Ricciardo will no doubt have double the motivation to put that right this year, though realistically he may have to wait for a first win in the principality.Monaco presents possibly the best chance for McLaren to finally get off the mark if it can capitalise on a track which is not dependant on outright power.Fernando Alonso's absence will be felt as he attempts to win Indy 500 at the first try, but Jenson Button's experience could be crucial in the cockpit of the MCL32 around the unforgiving streets of Monte Carlo.
