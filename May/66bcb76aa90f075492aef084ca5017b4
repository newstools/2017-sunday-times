Suskin, 56, a paediatrician specialising in newborns, now lives in Atlanta after emigrating from South Africa in 1988.But he has been coming back every year since 2014 for the Comrades, averaging a time of 11 hours 30 minutes, and hopes to run again this year - injuries permitting.The father of two flies hot-air balloons as a hobby and restores vintage cars for tours and races."I've flown a balloon nonstop across the US over three days and participated in events all over the US and Europe," said Suskin.He runs three to five marathons a year all over the world."The Comrades stands above them all, in terms of spirit, enjoyment and camaraderie," he said."It's the most special race anywhere. The sense of community both with the other runners and with the spectators that line the route from start to finish is unparalleled at any other event."Having grown up in South Africa and watched the race year after year, to return and be part of it gives me back a very small part of South Africa and makes me feel at home again," he said.Suskin said the most memorable moments of the ultra-marathon for him were the start and the route near Inchanga, where children from the Ethembeni School for the disabled traditionally line the road to cheer the runners on."Like many white South Africans my age, we did not grow up with this national anthem and like most others, we mumble our way through it until we reach the English parts."He was determined not to let that happen when he ran his first Comrades, "so I learnt the anthem properly, practising on my way to work every day", he said."Tears streamed down my face as I sang the anthem properly, in full, with all the other runners in Pietermaritzburg the first time."Every time we go past Ethembeni School and high-five the kids, their spirit seems to refuel me for the second half of the race."This year Suskin is determined to be part of the event, despite having sustained an injury six weeks ago shortly before the Marathon des Sables - a multistage race with a backpack across the Sahara."Even if I don't run, I will be at the race as I cannot get it out of my blood," he said.
