A new study of more than 1,000 young, affluent South African women revealed that having a healthy head of hair is paramount - while getting frisky in the bedroom or driving a posh car isn't that important.The demand among women for enviable tresses - be it natural or fake - is feeding a multimillion-rand hair industry and is largely fuelled by the celebrity set who often flaunt their locks and curls on social media platforms.Sex gives a 48-hour 'afterglow' that strengthens your bond with your bae Wololo hitmaker Babes Wodumo is the latest celeb to jump on the hair bandwagon. Wodumo - who apart from her music is famous for her colourful weaves - is planning to launch her own weave range because of her female fans' appetite for their own set.The jury is still out on whether weaves - which can cost up to R5,000 - trump natural hair among South African women, but experts and bloggers have noted a move towards organic, God-given manes.Hair and beauty blogger Lungi Zuma said "a lot of women" wanted to explore their natural hair."We're also seeing many more women on social media showcasing beautiful, natural hair and that is drawing in more women to going natural." Zuma said celebrities tended to go the weave route because it was regarded as "glamorous"."We don't see a lot of characters with natural hair in mainstream TV roles." The Twitter brigade celebrated last week when outgoing Miss USA Deshauna Barber took her final walk as the country's leading beauty wearing her hair in its natural state. Barber passed the crown to Kara McCullough, also a black woman wearing her natural hair with pride.Research company Insight Survey found that hair, generally, played an important role in South African women's self-esteem and confidence. When asked to rate on a scale of 1-10 how important healthy hair was to self-confidence, the average rating among South African women was 7.4 out of 10.Close to 70% of respondents in previous surveys said that healthy hair played a huge part in their self-image, while 55% said healthy hair built self-confidence and attracted the attention of the opposite sex.</img> Lungi Zuma says a lot of women want to explore their natural hair.
