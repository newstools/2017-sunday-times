They were assessed via several sleep-related tests, including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and other questionnaires.Why looking tired could kill your social appealThe scientists found that women were more likely to have sleep disorders associated with daytime sleepiness (49% compared to 36.9% for men). Women were also more likely to report an increased burden of symptoms linked to sleepiness.The study found that women were more likely to feel excessively tired or depressed, have difficulty concentrating or remembering things, and have more trouble sleeping at night.In addition, male snoring was more likely than female snoring to force bed partners to sleep in different rooms. The study results are published in the May 15 issue of the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine.
