The end result (13-6) marked a third win on tour - the first time a Lions team has won all of its tour matches in Super Rugby - and also stretched the Johannesburg franchise's current winning streak to a record eight matches.The last six have been away from home.The victory has set the Lions up well for the remainder of the campaign as they took complete control of the Africa Two standings with their 10th win in 11 matches. They have 46 log points with the Sharks a distant second on 32, with a game in hand.With three home matches to come, against the Bulls, Southern Kings and Sunwolves, the Lions are well set to position themselves for a home semifinal and final if they progress that far. Lions take points by force"The next three weeks are very important for us, but we will take nothing for granted," Lions captain Warren Whiteley said after the match."We've seen in this competition how the smaller unions have come out fighting so we won't take anyone lightly. We will pitch up every week and stay focused."It's a bit early to be talking about our title credentials. We don't look that far ahead but rather take it week by week. But winning all our matches on tour for the first time was a first and we're proud of that."A long-range solo try from flank Kwagga Smith, scored early in the second half, ultimately proved the difference between the two sides on a night when the Brumbies were left counting the cost of squandered chances.In the first half, the home team should have scored twice. Wing James Dargaville did cross the tryline, but upon video review it was declined when it emerged that No9 Joe Powell knocked-on in the build-up.Later, flank Scott Fardy dropped the ball cold with a clear tryline 15m in front of him. Those mistakes, coupled with some grim defence, kept the Lions in the match at the break.All the Brumbies had to show for their first-half dominance, which included the upper hand in the scrums, was a lone penalty from flyhalf Wharenui Hawera.After surviving off scraps in the first half, Lions flyhalf Elton Jantjies kicked a penalty to level the scores before Smith showed his Sevens pedigree, a scorching 53m run for the only try of the match.Lions centre Lionel Mapoe scooped up a poor pass from Brumbies fullback Aidan Toua and drew two defenders before slipping a deft offload to Smith."It was a grind out there, but we knew it was going to be," Whiteley said."Conditions were difficult because the ball was extremely slippery, so we knew we had to keep it tight. We had to fight for that victory because the Brumbies put us under pressure, including the set piece."The defeat for the Brumbies was their seventh of the season, but more worryingly for Australian rugby, it was collectively a ninth loss in 13 matches against South African opposition this season.Against New Zealand teams, Australian sides have lost 17 out of 17.sports@timesmedia.co.za
