It was barely halfway through the first day of #Cannes2017 when the head of this year's jury tasked with deciding which film would win the festival's most coveted prize, the Palme d'Or (due to be awarded tonight), made a bold statement - one that would hang over the 12-day event and dominate many a conversation on the Croisette.Revered Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almod var was addressing the contentious move by festival organisers to not allow any films that don't release theatrically, on the big screen, into the competition lineup from next year.'The Wound': brave local film gives a voice to gay Xhosa initiatesThis year, two films releasing solely on Netflix, Okja by South Korean director Bong Joon-ho, starring Tilda Swinton, and The Meyerowitz Stories, with Dustin Hoffman and Adam Sandler, were allowed to compete - which irked many cinephiles and traditional filmmakers.For some, the bypassing of a theatrical release for a film is a representation of US cultural imperialism. For others, it's just a sign of the times."For me, it would be a paradox if the winner of the Palme d'Or in Cannes, or any other award, couldn't be seen in cinemas," said Almod var."Digital platforms are a new way of offering paid content, which in principle can be good and enriching," he said, but "this new way shouldn't try to suppress the already existing ones, like going to the movies."Almost immediately, Almod var's fellow juror Will Smith weighed in, saying he did not believe Netflix to be anything but beneficial - not surprising, given that Smith's latest movie, the sci-fi fantasy Bright, will release on the platform this year."I have a 16-year-old and an 18-year-old and a 24-year-old at home. They go to the movies twice a week, and they watch Netflix. There's very little cross between going to the cinema and watching what they watch on Netflix," he said.He said a platform such as Netflix gave his children access to films and filmmakers they might otherwise not have experienced. "It has broadened my children's global cinematic comprehension," he said.Swinton, who plays the lead in Okja, said she felt that awards were not the pinnacle of achievement. "To be quite honest, we didn't come here to win prizes," she said. "We came here to show this film to the audience here at the Cannes Film Festival."Okja earned hearty praise, despite a few boos during the first press screening at the sight of the Netflix logo. Critics lauded the film, with its message of respect for the environment and animals, but decried the fact that its lead character - a lovable "super-pig" - wouldn't be seen on a big cinema screen in all her CGI glory.WATCH the trailer for Netflix's Okja As Swinton and Noah Baumbach - the director of the second Netflix title to debut at Cannes this week, The Meyerowitz Stories - attested, the streaming platform has championed the kinds of directors that major studios no longer seem to.Its model could well be worth following, suggested Swinton: "Netflix gave Bong Joon-ho a chance to make his liberated vision a reality, and for that I am grateful."The platform's reach is equally appealing. "Thousands of films are shown in Cannes that people never see in cinemas," said Swinton.Her co-star Jake Gyllenhaal echoed her sentiments: "It's truly a blessing when art can reach one person - particularly in today's age, when we are inundated with information, sometimes true, sometimes not - [and] that we can get the artistic expression in whatever form we can."Gyllenhaal said the film's wide reach would help spread its message, especially urgent at a time when the Trump administration is cutting back on environmental protections.But this doesn't mean filmmakers are happy to forego theatrical release. Baumbach said he made The Meyerowitz Stories expecting it to be shown on the big screen. He had already made the film, independently, when it was acquired by Netflix in the post-production stage. "I believe in the big screen, and I think it's unique and singular - an experience that's not going to go away, in my opinion," he said.story_article_right2Which is just as well for newer filmmakers, like the handful from South Africa who make their way to Cannes each year.Producer Cait Pansegrouw, from Urucu Media - which recently backed the Sundance debut of The Wound and helped get up-and-coming filmmaker Wim Steytler into Cannes's World Cinema programme - believes theatrical releases, and indeed film festivals, are still vital for building a reputation and audience, even if cinemagoing numbers are dwindling. "We were offered a Netflix deal for The Wound, and that was really exciting for us because it was a film we wanted a lot of people to see. [Director] John Trengove made that film for young queer people to see," said Pansegrouw.But the fact that it was Trengove's first feature film, she said, ultimately determined where it ended up. "It was made for cinema, and it was John's debut - the first film he would be building his career upon. Just because you're on a digital platform doesn't mean you have visibility," she said.For someone like playwright Mbongeni Ngema, who came to Cannes with a film version of his first stage production, Asinamali, going to the movies is part of the cultural fabric of a country. "There's no experience like the big-screen experience," he said. "Then [a film] can go to television, and then online."Asinamali is one of those classic South African stories that should have a life beyond just the stage," he said.And yet, for all the talk of what may or may not be happening inside a film theatre, the best experience for a handful of festivalgoers at this year's Cannes came from an unexpected place - an airplane hangar. That's where a virtual-reality creation from Oscar-winning director and cinematographer Alejandro I rritu and Emmanuel Lubezki, was screened for a select few as part of the official line-up.The festival's acceptance of this virtual-reality experience - based on true accounts of people crossing the Mexico/Arizona border - is a sign of faith in the medium and what's to come.Even more reassuring is the calibre of filmmaker putting their faith in it. Their work gave a hint of the power and potential - in scale and scope - that the future of cinema has to move audiences in ways they've never been moved before.
