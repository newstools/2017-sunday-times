With a try and five penalties, the Crusaders remain at the head of the table and unbeaten after 11 games while the reigning champion Hurricanes lie third in the New Zealand conference with their second defeat.The expectation ahead of the clash was for a try-fest between two sides renowned for their determination to attack from all angles but at half time the score was locked at 9-9 with all the points from penalties.Eventually the power of the Crusaders All Blacks-laden pack, and the smart direction of centre Ryan Crotty, defused the Hurricanes strike power of Beauden and Jordie Barrett and kept them tryless for the first time in three years. Bulls game dampens along with the weatherFor the Crusaders, even without injured Kieran Read and suspended Sam Whitelock, and despite Scott Barrett (ankle) and Matt Todd (concussion) leaving the field, they still had too much power up front."It was such a massive effort," said Crotty, who ended up captaining the side after Todd left the field."We didn't let them get anything going off set pieces which was massive, a credit to the tight five."The Crusaders went closest to crossing the line in the first half when Crotty took a leaf out of the Beauden Barrett playbook and sent a well-directed cross kick towards the corner, only for Seta Tamanivalu to knock the ball on. It took until the 50th minute before Todd was able to drive over for the only try of the game with a lineout drive that forced the Hurricanes pack back more than 10 metres.Despite dominating possession, the Crusaders let themselves down in the first half with 12 turnovers. But as fast as the Hurricanes were gifted possession they lost it with ill-discipline that cost them seven penalties in 40 minutes.The Crusaders forwards controlled scrums and the breakdown, leaving the Hurricanes backline starved of clean possession.
