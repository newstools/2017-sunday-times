"Like her sister's, a spin on tradition" was Harpers Bazaar's verdict, adding "she (Pippa) looked perfect.""It's a privilege to show the craftsmanship that my team produces in London and a real testament to Pippa's support of British fashion," Giles Deacon told the Daily Telegraph, complimenting Pippa on her "great eye" for fashion.Perhaps in anticipation of the post-wedding effect on his A-list client list, the designer announced plans to put his ready-to-wear line on hold in favor of developing the bespoke end of his business.</img>The Duchess of Cambridge adjusted Pippa Middleton's dress on Saturday, as the younger sibling did in 2011 during Kate and Prince William's wedding.
