While Pearl was praised on social media for her look, Khanyi faced some fire from Twitter's fashion police."#SAMA23 @PearlThusi is officially the @Beyonce of South Africa She is so lit," declared @TheRealSim_Okip."Best dressed for me @PearlThusi and Thando #SAMA23," said @Lele_mkz."Khanyi Mbau in a visual representation of how the mighty have fallen. What the hell is this dress ... bathong ... Hideous. #SAMA23," tweeted @Red_Mos."Khanyi Mbau and showing off what's up with them nipples now. This is a family show tu," wrote @MikeyMashila.And nipples, essentially, are why Pearl was the clear winner of this dress battle.The secret to pulling off a 'naked' dress is to strike a balance between revealing and concealing skin. Look for a dress that skilfully covers the right areas of your body with the right amount of beading, crystals or lace.Pearl showed just enough skin, whereas Khanyi s exposed nipples were an absolute no-no.A post shared by Pearl Thusi (@pearlthusi) on May 28, 2017 at 1:15am PDT A post shared by Khanyi Mbau METANOIA (@mbaureloaded) on May 29, 2017 at 2:17am PDT Just like with any other garment, fit is key. A 'naked dress' should look like your skin, so make sure the fabric hugs your body and falls in the most flattering places.Pearl s dress fit her like a glove; the nude shade of the material was also the perfect compliment to her skin tone.The top and waist of Khanyi's gown, on the other hand, were ill-fitting resulting in a less than flattering overall look.A post shared by Pearl Thusi (@pearlthusi) on May 28, 2017 at 1:04am PDT A post shared by Khanyi Mbau METANOIA (@mbaureloaded) on May 29, 2017 at 2:23am PDTKhanyi also failed in the underwear department; her choice of yellow high-waisted panties did nothing to flatter the dress or her figure. While Pearl's nude underwear enhanced the illusion that her body was simply sprinkled with artfully-placed sparkles.A post shared by Khanyi Mbau METANOIA (@mbaureloaded) on May 29, 2017 at 12:01am PDTA post shared by Pearl Thusi (@pearlthusi) on May 27, 2017 at 1:31pm PDT
