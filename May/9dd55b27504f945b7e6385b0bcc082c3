Good luck trying to clean your ship amid level-four water restrictions, effective from June 1, which limit water use to drinking, washing and cooking.Neither would he get far filling his water barrels from the small trickle filtering down Table Mountain.That's because the Cape of Storms is a parched landscape with well under 100 days of potable water left for Cape Town's nearly four million people.We need your help! Desperate Cape Town officials beg weather experts for rain predictionA major reason for things drying up is that the very storms that once threw ships onto the shore are nowhere to be seen, pushed out to sea by atmospheric conditions.This week, scientists confirmed residents' worst fears: the winter storms that have always filled the dams may never return quite as before, due to a growing list of possibly interrelated factors including climate change, melting sea ice, ocean temperatures and ozone over the poles."These are all very subtle and poorly understood," said Chris Jack from the University of Cape Town climate system analysis group, one of several scientists joining forces to help the city figure out what has happened to its rain.A panel discussion of top climate scientists this week reached a consensus: prepare for drier weather over the next 30 to 40 years."Basically, every global climate model simulation available indicates a reduction in rainfall for the region in the long term," Jack said."This is because of the increasing influence of the regional high-pressure systems and the corresponding shift in the cold front storm tracks towards the south."Francois Engelbrecht, from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, said this was "one of the most robust and reliable signals in projections of future climate change for our region".However, the trouble with climate change predictions is that periodic droughts are also natural, raising the possibility that the current dry spell could be part of a long-term cycle.Western Cape water emergency sparks indaba led by Zille and Mokonyane The Western Cape endured almost a decade of drought about 50 years ago, according to climate scientist Mathieu Rouault."One might conclude that maybe [what we are seeing] is the start of global warming, but if you look at the '60s and '70s, these conditions happened then as well," he said."We don't know when global warming will kick in. But maybe this is a good wake-up call for us to get ready."A key difference between the Cape Town of 50 years ago and today is about three million people. Average daily consumption routinely tops 800 million litres, although recent restrictions have brought that down to around 700million.Frantic city officials are experimentally tapping into an aquifer beneath Table Mountain and dredging has begun at Voelvlei dam, near Riebeeck West, to allow for extraction of low-level water.By contrast, heavy rainfall across much of the interior, particularly in Gauteng, has filled the dams to capacity. Sputnik Ratau, spokesman for the Department of Water and Sanitation, said average national storage was at 72.7% compared with 54% a year ago. Navels contemplate disaster A citrus expert says a "perfect storm" of climate conditions is to blame for the loss of around half of this year's navel orange crop in the Eastern Cape.Thousands of oranges split, and Hannes Bester of Citrus Research International, who was called in to investigate, said the weather was responsible."There were temperatures of over 40 C with very low relative humidity of 7% or 8%, coupled with [warm and high-speed winds], which all drew moisture from the flowers and fruit," he said."This occurred during early cell division, and as the fruit increased in size during subsequent cell enlargement, the rind split open."Bester said the same phenomenon had been seen last year in Mpumalanga. "This year it's in the Eastern Cape, particularly the Sundays River Valley, and to a lesser extent in the Western Cape."Researchers were studying hormone treatments and better irrigation methods in an attempt to prevent a repeat of the crisis. - Dave Chambers
