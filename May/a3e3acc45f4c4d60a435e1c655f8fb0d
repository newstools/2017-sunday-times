Kent Jacobs Boutwell, in a lawsuit filed this month, says it was during a stay in May 2015 that he entered his "darkened hotel room and was shocked and surprised by a human figure in the room".Thinking it could be an attacker, he turned to flee but tripped and fell instead.The figure turned out to be part of the movie-themed hotel's d cor - a life-sized mannequin standing in a glass cabinet, wearing a Miller Light racing suit.Boutwell and his lawyer say having a life-sized figure in a darkened room is dangerous and hazardous, and that Planet Hollywood had an obligation to warn him about it before he entered the room.He accuses the hotel of "wilful, intentional, oppressive, malicious" conduct, saying it "intentionally placed a mannequin dressed in human clothing in the guest room" and "created the situation that caused [him] to feel apprehension of harmful or offensive contact".Boutwell is seeking damages in excess of $10,000 for assault and negligence, medical expenses, lost earnings and attorney's fees.Boutwell claims he suffered undefined injuries to his mind, body, limbs, organs and nervous system after seeing the figure.Furthermore, he says the experience has limited what he can now do for a living and for fun, and has decreased his enjoyment of life.He also says his conditions have the potential to be permanent and disabling.The Caesars Entertainment Group, which owns Planet Hollywood, declined to comment on the case but said in a statement: "While we do not comment on pending litigation, historically many of the Planet Hollywood rooms were decorated with memorabilia, which has been removed during a $125-million full modernisation and renovation of all 2,496 rooms."
