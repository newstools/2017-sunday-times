Cape Comoot will initially run from Greenmarket Square to Cape Point and Franschhoek, charging R99 for a one-way trip. According to co-founder Yolandie Le Grange, tourists are currently paying R800 to R1,500 per person for such trips.The shuttles have air conditioning, free wifi and cellphone charging stations.While they are already open for bookings - see capecomoot.com - they begin running from June 1, starting with two daily departure times to each destination. These are expected to be increased in the future, along with buses to Stellenbosch and Hermanus too.Martin Bo Nielsen, the founder of Cape Town Free Walking Tours, is also behind the new company. While the shuttles are for everyone, Nielsen explains the idea came from their interactions with foreign tourists."On the walking tours, guests ask us all the time if there are any simple public transport options to destinations outside Cape Town. Independent travellers also want to go straight to their destination, without sitting through 20 stops along the way or taking a tour bus."We are trying to create an alternative to renting your own car, and as Cape Town is growing into a global destination we think it is time for a service like this."
