The two sides clash at Ellis Park tomorrow going into the Super Rugby match with vastly contrasting fortunes in this year.The Bulls have lost seven games this season, the last two at home.The Lions have just returned from an unbeaten three-match tour of Australia and, although their confidence is in the stratosphere, ever-wise captain Warren Whiteley has urged his teammates to keep their feet on the ground. Lions in for 'hardest rugby of their lives'"You can't underestimate anyone," Whiteley warned."I don't need to tell you what we've seen in the last few rounds. Anything can happen. As a player you need to remain grounded. They [the Bulls] are going to fight. They will be determined and we know they have quality players. It's going to be one hell of a game."Coach Johan Ackermann agreed: "You know they will come at us with energy," he said having named his team in a way which proves he is not taking the Bulls lightly.The Lions have their first-choice front row of Jacques van Rooyen, Malcolm Marx and Ruan Dreyer starting.Cheetahs coach Franco Smith has rung the changes for his side's demanding clash in Wellington tomorrow and, as part of his rotational policy, elevated loosehead Ox Nch , hooker Elandr Huggett, tighthead Johan Coetzee, lock Armandt Koster, flank Uzair Cassiem and scrumhalf Shaun Venter to the starting lineup.As for the Stormers, who have made much of their attempt to adopt more attacking New Zealand style of play, one Kiwi believes they shouldn't veer too far from their traditional strengths.Blues forward coach Steve Jackson says South African rugby teams' attempts to copy the New Zealand game could be to their own detriment.Of course, with the Blues playing the Stormers at Newlands today it could be that Jackson is playing mind games."You've got to work to your strengths. That's what we do back home. Our strength is that we've got a lot of guys with flair who come through a system that can deliver that for us and we play to that."South African teams, with born and bred big men, should just keep playing up front."TMG Digital
