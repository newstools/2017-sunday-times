Have you invested in Amazon Echo? Goes by the name of Alexa. Can-do attitude, turns off the lights for you and forewarns you of rain. It can even be called upon as a witness in a murder trial?Meet the Echo Look: ''Everything you love about Alexa and now she can help you look your best".A hands-free camera with built in LED lighting and background blur (to help your outfits ''pop", apparently), this is a cross between a helpful friend and an AI selfie stick, as demonstrated by a group of well-dressed women, mostly millennial age and one man, who doesn't speak.You can make a personal lookbook of outfits, or even get a ''style check", where Alexa will choose the more stylish and flattering outfit of two.While I don't make a habit of selfies, I'll admit to sending outfit shots to friends - mine happen to be fashion stylists - for advice if I've got a tricky dress code to meet (or am just having my biannual wardrobe wobble) and, at least, you don't have to wait for Alexa to text back.WATCH: see how Echo Look works Having the guesswork taken out of an outfit might make Monday mornings less of a chore and it could help you shop less - or shop more tactically - by showing you what's missing from your wardrobe, what you've got too much of, what actually suits you.The idea of photographing my outfits makes me cringe but I'll admit to missing the next-big-thing boat in the past.I waved off iPhones for years, thought Instagram was a waste of time, and continued to haul six different books on holiday because ''Kindles didn't smell the same" until I was finally and firmly converted to all three.Perhaps the Echo Look could be the future of getting dressed but there's a problem - Alexa might be able to help you get ready but she'll never be able to zip up your dress. - The Daily Telegraph This article was originally published in The Times.
