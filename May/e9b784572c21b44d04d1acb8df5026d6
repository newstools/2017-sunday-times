It is a tough environment for consumers.And Kevin Hodgson, CEO of Holdsport, which owns the sport apparel stores Sportsman's Warehouse and Outdoor Warehouse, does not expect the pressure to lift in the medium term.While the retailer's target market was in a high-income bracket, the company was still feeling the pinch even if not to the same extent as in the lower and middle income brackets, he said.
