The golfer s company has bought Stellenzicht which neighbours its 178-acre estate between Somerset West and Stellenbosch and dates back to 1692.The "Big Easy" is a partner in the company controlled since 2015 Baron Hans von Staff-Reitzenstein a German real-estate investor and industrialist.Andrew Harris head of marketing and sales for Ernie Els Wines told TimesLive the Stellenzicht deal was part of a strategy to secure more of its own fruit.The 550-acre property with 250 acres planted is one of the largest in the region. Harris would not disclose the purchase price but said it was less than the rumoured listing price of R128-million.Ernie Els Wines established 17 years ago produces 100,000 cases a year with almost half sold in South Africa. Its biggest export markets are the US and Germany.Harris said the Stellenzicht purchase from Lusan Holdings did not mean output would increase. We re not really looking to chase a huge amount of volume. It all comes down to the Helderberg terroir he said.The Ernie Els team led by winemaker Louis Strydom will move to the new farm in early July but Lusan will own the Stellenzicht name for another two years while it sells off existing stock.Replanting at Stellenzicht traditionally a Rhone farm will begin next year. Harris said while 60% of Ernie Els Wines were cabernet sauvignons soil analysis would guide the replanting process.Els had always been a passive investor in the business said Harris. I was with him on Saturday and he s very interested and passionate he said. We report to him monthly and as long as there s more black ink than red he s happy.
