Thompson, the Olympic women's 100m and 200m champion, and 110m hurdles gold medallist McLeod were among the marquee performers in yesterday's Shanghai Diamond League competition, which featured rematches of key Rio Games battles.Bolt, the greatest sprinter in history with eight Olympic golds, 11 world titles and three world records, will retire from international competition after the world championships in August."It's saddening that he's retiring, but there is nothing we can do to change his mind," McLeod said wistfully in Shanghai. Simbine sets Doha alight by beating biggest names in his career yet"But what we can do, as young emerging Jamaican athletes, is shine our own lights and try our very best to keep the flag flying high." Thompson added: "He's a legend. He's done so much for the country. We can't be like him, but we can follow in his footsteps and motivate each other to continue to raise the flag higher."In Shanghai, Thompson will face off in the 100m with America's Tori Bowie for the first time since they went one-two in Rio, where Thompson became the first woman since Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988 to win the 100m-200m double.Jamaica's new sprint queen has been in good form this year but feels there is still "room for improvement" as she gears up for the world championships in London."This is preparation for me to compete for the world championship," she said.McLeod also has run well lately, clocking the fastest 110m hurdles of the year two weeks ago - a 13.04sec - at the Drake Relays.He will line up alongside Spain's Orlando Ortega, who took Olympic silver last year, and a handful of others who have previously run sub-13 times including past world champion Aries Merritt of the US.In yet another Rio rematch, Brazilian Thiago Braz will vie with world record holder Renaud Lavillenie of France in the pole vault.Braz stunned the Frenchman, the defending champion and hot favourite, last August to take gold with an Olympic record 6.03m in a memorable battle in which Lavillenie was mercilessly jeered by the home crowd.Two-time Olympic champion David Rudisha, however, will be the clear favourite in the 800m, with no other Olympic medallists in the field.A number of top men's sprinters, including Rio 100m silver medallist Justin Gatlin of the US, are skipping Shanghai, leaving a depleted field for the race.Gatlin finished fourth at the Doha Diamond League last week, where unheralded South African Akani Simbine surprisingly outsprinted a world-class field for the win.
