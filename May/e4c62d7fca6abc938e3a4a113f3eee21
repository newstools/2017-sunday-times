Mtongana was the only author from the continent to be honoured in the special awards category for her debut cookbook My Table which is a runaway bestseller.It has outstripped the sales of any cookbook stocked by Woolworths and the recipes for her cooking show have been translated into many languages including Russian and Arabic.After accepting the award on Friday Mtongana said: I am absolutely honoured to receive this prestigious global recognition not only for me but for my country South Africa and my continent Africa. Mtongana told The Times: There is so much young Africans have to contribute to the global community. It s my goal to represent and showcase the continent s drive innovation and skill on the international stage. Participating in the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards is just one way in which to do that.
