Gigaba held several rounds of bilateral talks on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Africa with investors and leaders to assure them of consistency of policy and efforts to boost investor confidence.This follows the change of ministers in the surprise cabinet reshuffle at the end of March and the downgrade of the sovereign credit rating to junk last month.Gigaba met Singapore's deputy prime minister, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, on Friday at the World Economic Forum on Africa in Durban. Don't blame me for junk, says GigabaSpeaking to reporters afterwards, he said they discussed addressing inclusive growth, stimulating economic growth in South Africa, raising the revenue base, "issues related to the ease of doing business in South Africa and engagement between ourselves and Singapore on financial matters"."I have indicated to the deputy prime minister that as part of our next road show we do intend visiting Singapore to meet with the Asian fund managers and also exchange on bilateral issues between our two finance ministries to discuss issues of tax collection, the management of fiscal policy and talk broadly about issues of social economic policy co-ordination."Gigaba and Shanmugaratnam also discussed views on issues relating to ratings agencies and what South Africa was doing to improve its investment outlook and restore its investment grade.Shanmugaratnam said the "fundamentals for expanding trade and investment" between South Africa and Singapore from its current low levels were tremendous. But "having clarity about the investment climate is important".Boston Consulting Group MD Adam Ikdal said: "Right now people are uncertain. When we talk to clients - international clients wanting to invest in South Africa - the first question they ask us is what does radical economic transformation mean and how likely are aggressive policies to come from government going forward? Wanted: radical economic information"There are a lot of people that would like to invest in South Africa but are now sitting on the fence until they can get a better understanding of what radical economic transformation actually means."Investors are quite clinical in the way they look at things. They see the rhetoric, but now they are going to look at what is going to be implemented in the next budget cycle."Rudolph du Plessis, partner at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills South Africa, said investors would have factored mergers and acquisitions activities into their decision-making for a couple of years.But the downgrades would affect the ability to fund transactions and the structure of transactions.Volatility in the currency could drive M&amp;A activity as some people regarded this as an opportunity to pick up investments cheaply."Investors from India and China may look at what ratings agencies say slightly different from companies in the US for example," he said.
