Tonight Missibaba hosts Cape Town jewellery designers Ida Elsje and Philippa Green, who will exhibit their individual brands alongside their shared brand Nunc Diamond Jewellery.''The appealing strong lines of Pierre Swanepoel's Trumpet design, in such close proximity to the formidable Circa Galley, make for an exciting new hub of art and design," say Missibaba partners Chloe Townsend and Lizel Strydom.African meets Asia in Michelle Liao's big, bold jewelry designsMissibaba was offered an unusual space that was originally marked to be a storage unit, but its faceted lines, levels, unique angles and distinctive surface details appealed to the design and marketing team.''The space demanded to be treated as a jewel," they say. ''So we decided to tackle the shop-fitting project hands-on, not using architects or interior designers."The shop is a sensory explosion, with a gold vinyl panel leading to the entrance, which pulls customers through the double volume glass stack doors.A vintage McIntosh sideboard from mid-century second-hand furniture store Decade adorns the jewel-box corner.Chrome standing lamps and a round chrome table with glass top fill the centre of the store.After a few months in the store, the Missibaba team say they feel an irresistible urge to play with different product placement.''It's a true reflection of our love for design and layered interior spaces," they say.''We want the shop to be an ever-evolving gallery space, showcasing limited-edition Missibaba collections and art pieces as well as welcoming other creatives to collaborate on new projects."</img>Ida Elsje, Chloe Townsend, Lizel Strydom and Philippa Green come together for an exhibition of jewellery tonight.
