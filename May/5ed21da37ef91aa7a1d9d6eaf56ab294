King Cetshwayo's army lost more than 1,000 men in the battle on January 22 1879, but the British death toll was about 1,400. The previously undiscovered bones of many combatants were recently found at the site in a mass grave.Now, historians and war experts are worried that a planned lodge and cultural village with a possible price tag of R30-million will be built virtually on top of "the bones of the dead".Questions are also being asked over who will fund the development, and whether it will promote tourism or simply be another palace for Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. What the extravagant Zulu king is costing youThe king already has seven palaces.Initial reports suggested that R30-million in lottery and state funding had been allocated to the "affirmation village and garden of remembrance" to honour the memory of those who died at Isandlwana, which was a historic defeat for the forces of colonial Britain.The site of the development is used every year for war re-enactments.The developer, the KwaZulu-Natal Arts and Culture Trust, originally said the project would provide accommodation for battlefield tourists, and would create jobs in the impoverished Nquthu district.The original design included a 66-bed tourism lodge, a "luxury king's rondavel", conference centre, restaurant, helipad, statue of King Cetshwayo, entertainment boma and cattle kraal.But the recent discovery of several forgotten graves of Zulu and British combatants - virtually in the middle of the development site - has prompted a belated redesign following strong protests by Anglo-Zulu War historians.This week Gugu Ngcobo, CEO of the arts and culture trust, said the 11 beehive-style rondavels would not be available for battlefield tourists after all, and the development would include accommodation of royal standard where King Zwelithini would stay when he visited.She dismissed reports of a R30-million price tag, suggesting the first phase would cost about R12-million. She said the national Department of Arts and Culture was expected to sponsor the statues and war memorial park, and private sector donations were a possibility.</img> Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini already has seven palaces.

Spokeswoman Kenosi Setlhako said costs were "confidential" and invited the Sunday Times to submit a formal information application under the Promotion of Access to Information Act.The Arts and Culture Department has only made a commitment to build the statue of King Cetshwayo and the Isandlwana War memorial, but would not pay for operational costs.Asked if the development was a palace for King Zwelithini, the department said the project was to honour those who died in the battle.A spokesman for the king did not respond when asked if the project was intended to become another royal palace.During an environmental impact assessment last year, 11 mass grave sites were found within the 6ha development footprint.The identities of those in the graves cannot be established, since the remains of the soldiers who fell at Isandlwana were only buried months, and in some cases several years, later.King s wish gets answered with a R50 million budget A heritage impact study by archaeologist Frans Prins found the unmarked graves probably contained the remains of both Zulu and British combatants.Ian Knight, the noted British author who has written extensively about the battle, is one of several historians who objected to the positioning of the development."My objection is not to the palace itself, but to the location. In my view it shouldn't be built on the bones of the dead of either side. Move it half a mile away and surely everyone will be happy," he said.Before his death last year, internationally acclaimed military historian Ken Gillings also voiced concern that the development was being "fast-tracked because of political pressure".Battlefield tour guide Paul Marais said the development was close to where the fiercest fighting had taken place."If a building is placed here it destroys all understanding of the amazing courage that the Zulu regiments displayed as they ran uphill to overcome the British position. I am sure a more suitable position could be found," Marais said.Following the environmental impact assessment and heritage impact studies last year, Prins recommended that the human bones should not be exhumed. Instead, there should be a 30m-wide buffer zone and fence to protect them from disturbance.Last month the KwaZulu-Natal environmental affairs department granted final authorisation for the project on condition that the plans be reconfigured to include a 10m-wide buffer zone for the graves. An appeal has been lodged against the decision.During the environmental impact assessment process, consultants also considered two other sites as alternatives for the development, but these were rejected as being too small or otherwise unsuitable.
