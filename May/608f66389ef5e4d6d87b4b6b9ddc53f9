You can't help but have a fairy tale moment when you see Fleur De La Vie's long-lasting natural roses. For, like the enchanted rose in Beauty and the Beast, the beauty of these blooms lasts and lasts for anything from six months to a year, in fact. And they don't need any water.How's this wizardry possible? Fleur De La Vie uses an eco-friendly technology to process the flowers giving them an extended lifespan. To keep them looking their best, however, they shouldn't be exposed to direct sunlight or humidity. These long-lasting flowers get even more magical when it comes to the colours available think everything from classic pink and white to imaginative green and black.The one thing that isn't quite so magical is the price. You'll pay anything from R550 for a single rose packaged in a clear acrylic box to R4,950 for 55 roses.
