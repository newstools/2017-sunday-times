We scrolled through Queen B's Instagram to see how her fashion sense has evolved over the years. We loved a few looks from Bonang s street-style forays during New York Fashion Week in 2016, and this custom-made, pastel blue suit is one of our favourites. Her monochromatic accessories are on-trend and fabulous, and overall she looks like a million bucks.A post shared by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Sep 13, 2016 at 1:29pm PDT Compare this look to the ill-fitting, bright red suit she wore way back in 2012 and it's clear she's evolved into a more chic and elegant fashionista.A post shared by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Jul 21, 2012 at 10:37am PDT Bonang makes a lot of red carpet appearances and often showcases South African designers like her favourite, Gert Johan Coetzee. While in recent years she is getting it right more and more frequently, she has made some prom-fashion faux-pas in the past.Designer heels make Bonang's heart beat faster The whimsical Warrick Gautier dress she recently wore to the 2017 SAFTAS was fit for a queen.

(Also wearing sunglasses indoors is a solid example of a fashion trend that must die and sadly still hasn't!)A post shared by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Feb 3, 2013 at 7:42am PST Bonang s Instagram feed features two white looks with corset-like seam detailing, but they re not of the same standard even though she wore them just months apart.10 style lessons to learn from BonangThe A-line, full-skirted look she wore during New York Fashion Week in 2016 is gorgeously minimalist, and the contrasting black accessories make for a chromatically chic touch.A post shared by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Sep 12, 2016 at 1:41pm PDTThe almost bridal, 70s-looking lace dress that she wore to the races earlier last year, on the other hand, isn't great, and the mini dress beneath is the straw that broke the camel s back. What a difference a few months make!A post shared by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Jan 11, 2016 at 3:02am PST
