It is universally accepted that a student and a regular shower are not the best of friends. The idea is so ingrained in the minds of students all over the world you would think that one of the entry requirements to institutions of higher learning is the disavowal of water and soap.Leading the charge in this war is the average male student. But the politically aware girl who quotes Frantz Fanon at the drop of a hat, smokes and has an abhorrence of bras, is an important warrior in the anti-water struggle.Remember that these are politically conscious youngsters. And the tentacles of political activism extend into the eco-friendly realm. Avoid a shower. Save water. Save the planet. Amen. Boffins beat cold-shower blues with hot gadgetThe average male student will take an average of two-and-a-half showers a week in summer. In winter, the frequency drops by one third.However, when water has been fortified with fermentable and distillable ingredients, then the male student gives us an impressive performance.Man alive! We see him up there in the stratosphere, his encounters with water (fortified, fermented and distilled) having suddenly rocketed to an impressive five full days a week.But back to the matter of showers. Plain water, untouched by fermentable or distillable ingredients, is given a wide berth if you are a male student.I've always known this. Been in those trenches, brought home the T-shirt that had been slept in so many times it could be made to stand by itself on the ground, its shape tracing the contours of the Khumalo corpus.Experienced as I am in the Struggle Against Regular Showers (SARS), I simply was not prepared for what befell me early this week, on the streets of Stellenbosch.I use the word "befell" advisedly. I almost fell on the pavement when the two fellas passed by. It was as if I'd been hit by a car. Or I'd been caught in the vortex of a mammoth truck whooshing past at ferocious speed.I staggered. I saw blue stars flashing. I thought I was having a cardiac arrest.These fellas must be the Julius Malemas of the Struggle Against Regular Showers. The malodorous emanations from their combined bodies would bamboozle even Mufasa the lion.In the service of the never-ending struggles of this country, those young men must be paraded at student rallies: "Comrades, if you want to know what a student revolutionary smells like, come to the stage and get a whiff!" Citizens' anger can be used to devise a new political agendaSouth Africans are creative in how we prosecute our struggle. In the 1980s when we mounted boycotts of some shops, whenever the comrades encountered people who had broken the boycott, they would make them sit right there in the middle of the road and start eating items they'd bought from the accursed shop.If the sell-outs (everybody the comrades did not like was a sell-out) had washing powder, all the better. Eat your washing powder, so you shall be cleansed of your sins! Amen.If the comrades found cooking oil in your grocery packets, well, drink it up, sell-out!However, if they found some ncamnce, township parlance for delectable snacks such as cheese, potato chips or polony, the comrades would be like: "Well, sell-out, you can't eat by yourself while the masses are starving!"In solidarity with the starving masses the comrades would consume the sell-out's cheese and polony.The struggle has come a long way. It mutates so it can confound the enemy. These days the comrades simply throw buckets of poo at cops and the authorities during service-delivery protests.Remember how students stripped naked and ran up the streets in protest against rape at university campuses?There is therefore nothing to rule out the possibility that the two students I encountered were making some political point.Students are always at the cutting edge of revolutionary protest. The Fallist movement, after all, came from the trenches of student activism.Maybe after a smoke or two, one of the young men I bumped into said to his friend: "Look, comrade, let's take the Fallist Movement to another level..." We've done #FeesMustFall, #RhodesMustFall, #ZumaMustFall ... But there is something that is very close to No1 that we haven't done anything about "Well, comrade, explain and don't talk with a smoke in your hands. Let me take a hit while you expound."Long puff! And: "Well, comrade, we've done #FeesMustFall, #RhodesMustFall, #ZumaMustFall ... But there is something that is very close to No1 that we haven't done anything about.""What's that?""Showers.""Now, comrade, don't get me started on that. Who said I want to go take a shower?""Exactly my point! ShowersMustFall.""Damn, this Swazi poison is good. Smoking it has made you come up with a brilliant idea after such a long drought of originality! Yes, #ShowersMustFall!""Let's lead by example, then. No showers until No1 is gone!"#ShowersMustFall.
