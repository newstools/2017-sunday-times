Looking for a place to stay about halfway between Bot River and Port Elizabeth, I was told of a special spot near Wilderness.Set atop a hill overlooking Wilderness beach, its lakes and mountains beyond, Hilltop Country Lodge is aptly named.But when you have been stunned by the view from your balcony for a few hours as I was, your euphoria may tempt you to make up even more romantic epithets.Weekend Escape: Robertson Small Hotel, Breede River ValleyI got back up the hill feeling a bit like an Attenborough acolyte, inspired by the natural fecundity around me and drenched with the effort of lugging camera gear through dense forests singing with cicadas.But the strain I took on the path that leads down to the railway bridge over the Kaaimans River mouth had more to do with an acute sinus infection than the severity of the trail.The private nature reserve at the lodge, like just about everything else here, revolves around allowing guests to soak up the jaw-dropping vistas from a number of view-sites.The walk to the railway line took about half an hour, with brief stops at the Kaaimans River valley and the Kaaimans River bridge viewpoints and finally, the ocean view-site.I'd spent most of my time at the Kaaimans River railway bridge view-site, daydreaming of what the Outeniqua Choo Tjoe must have looked like huffing and puffing its way across this most scenic of crossings.It was Africa's last continually operated steam-hauled passenger train (it started in 1928) until the devastating floods of 2006 forced an end to the operation.I'm told Classic Rail are hopeful services on this line will resume in the next few years.Had I been feeling less like a wounded infantryman making a last push at the enemy lines in the forests of Borneo, I would have definitely taken the longer, circular route back to the lodge. But I felt I'd absorbed enough punishment and natural beauty for one day. Weekend Escape: Port Wine Guest House, CalitzdorpEn route, not only had I imprinted some of the finest Garden Route vistas on my memory but I had also notched up a number of noteworthy birds, among them a Burchell's coucal, a brownhooded kingfisher and what I thought was a lanner falcon, but couldn't be a 100% sure.My afternoon swim in the lodge's large pool was invigorating.Later, I decided not to visit one of the nearby restaurants but to simply warm up the tuna quiche my beloved had packed for me in the lodge's help-yourself dining-room.Being a Sunday night, the lodge was empty, but I had plenty of company as the smell of my supper - as well as my outward love of felines - drew an audience of the lodge's friendly cats.Thinking of the night-cap on my view-imbued balcony that was still to come, I wasn't sure who was purring louder with contentment, them or me.Where is it: 2.4km off the N2 and 10km from George.What it has: Eight rooms, all with breathtaking sea views; two family rooms with lofts for children and self-catering facilities, plus one room with mountain views.
