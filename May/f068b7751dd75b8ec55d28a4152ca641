A well-placed source in the DA said emissaries had been sent to Zille to see whether she would be open to a more amicable solution than driving a disciplinary process to its bitter end or starting a court case.Thus far, these efforts had not borne fruit, the source said.Zille is facing a disciplinary hearing on four charges brought by DA leader Mmusi Maimane, including bringing the party into disrepute, publicly opposing its values and policies and acting in a manner that is unreasonable and detrimental to internal co-operation in the DA. Zille's Asian trip will cost you R1.1millionA date for the hearing has still not been set.The battle between Maimane and Zille has caused much tension in the DA, and leaders fear that the party stands to lose support in all communities as a result of the internal fight - for different reasons among different population groups.This has prompted some in the party to urge damage control.Sources have also confirmed that Maimane raised the matter behind closed doors in the DA parliamentary caucus on Thursday.Maimane is said to have told the caucus that he would defend the values and policies of the DA against whoever brings them into disrepute.Insiders said he had told them that he believed the issue was counterproductive at a time when the DA needed to be unified to realise the opportunities presented by a weakening ANC.He also told the meeting that he did not believe Zille to be a racist.Although Zille has several supporters in the caucus, none had risen to the bait and no discussion had ensued, the source said.DA spokeswoman Phumzile van Damme declined to comment, saying the caucus was a closed meeting.
