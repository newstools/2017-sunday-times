Vitamin supplementation Patrick Holford, the vitamin expert, quotes a study in which vitamin C was taken in high doses (at least 1000mg) as a flu fighter. "Patients' cold symptoms reduced by 85% compared to those receiving conventional cold and flu treatment," he said. It can also be taken to prevent flu, along with zinc and vitamin D. Natural goodness. Echinacea is a natural immune booster and can assist with symptoms of colds and flu. Berries, cherries and other blue-red foods contain infection-fighting anthocyanidin compounds. Anti-inflammatories like turmeric and ginger are also effective. "The natural remedies really work, but you have to take them continuously and consistently. Every day, throughout flu season," says Kruger. If you have been ill for more than a week, and symptoms are not easing, visit your doctor. Some viruses, viral or fungal pneumonia and serious infections must be treated carefully.
