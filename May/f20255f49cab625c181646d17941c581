We put out a call to readers to be part of the panel of tasters. They came together on a Saturday morning at the HTA Culinary School in Randburg, Johannesburg, to taste ready-made lemon cheesecakes from three leading supermarkets.They were presented with each of the products "naked" without any branding or packaging. The desserts were judged on five qualities - appearance, base, filling, flavour and textureAuditor Jade Craig was on hand to monitor the objectivity of the blind-tasting process, from removing the packaging to numbering the products, overseeing the preparation and adding up the score sheets. Judges' comments:"Well balanced, I enjoyed the lemon flavour.""I'm not a fan of the ginger-biscuit base but there's more cream cheese and real cream than the other samples.""It looks great, good texture and filling, has a pleasant lemon taste.""A lovely dessert. All the elements are well balanced."Price: R64.99 Judges' comments:"It was too thick and the lemon flavour was missing. The base was very dry and crumbly.""Base is not compacted enough. It has more of a whipped-cream texture, without a lemon flavour.""It looks good but tasted like old takkies.""It is visually appealing with a nice fluffy filling."Price: R57.90 Judges' comments:"A soggy base with strong cottage-cheese flavour and not lemony enough. Very average dessert.""Neon-yellow topping looks artificial although it was edible with strong lemon flavour. Left almost 'chemical' aftertaste.""A wannabe cheesecake - luminous and synthetic.""Tastes artificial. This is not a proper cheesecake."Price: R49.99
