And it seems that the smaller e-commerce players need those legacy retailers to achieve scale and survive."We do think that when strong retail brands prioritise and roll out a proper multichannel strategy, it will boost e-commerce growth as a whole as they have a role to play in creating higher trust levels in that space," said Vincent Hoogduijn, CEO of Media24 e-commerce division, which owns online apparel e-tailer Spree.Hoogduijn added that to survive in a tough retail climate, traditional retailers had no option but to diversify their distribution channels and go multichannel."It's the only way forward if you look at how consumers behave nowadays."Spree is one of the many South African e-tailers capitalising on the increasing number of consumers moving to online portals. It competes directly with Takealot.com, which recently received a R960-million capital injection from Naspers in exchange for a majority stake. No sport in retail's troublesKim Reid, CEO at Takealot, said traditional retailers had to invest in e-commerce retailing because their "business is being eroded by e-commerce"."You've got a cannibalisation of normal retail happening, and then you've just got growth of business and those economic elements. The cannibalisation effect is greater than the knock-on effect of just the economy today," he said.But Reid believes that e-commerce retailers do not need the aid of legacy businesses to develop and scale up."We largely exist on smaller margins, we don't have shop fronts, we don't have staff sitting in store. But there is nothing sitting in retail today that we need, that will make us grow faster or differently," said Reid.The Takealot group owns brands such as Mr D, Takealot.com, Superbalist and Mr D Courier.Reid said Takealot's e-commerce business was growing relatively strongly compared to the performance of traditional retailers, which had not been robust in the current economic climate.For the past two years, South Africa's retail environment has been marked by high inflation and weak consumer spend, wreaking havoc on the bottom lines of traditional retailers.Yet, despite this, Reid said: "We are not currently experiencing significant weakness in our market, which bodes well for us as it means there is something behind our growth apart from normal retail trends."In the past eight months US-based retailer Walmart, the biggest retailer in the world with net sales of more than $481.32-billion, has bought several online businesses.In the UK, 133-year-old retailer Marks &amp; Spencer is looking to trial an online food-delivery system later this year.South Africa's online retailers contribute about 1% to total retail market share, with the non-grocery retail market contributing less than 2%.But players such as Shoprite and Woolworths have also deepened their investments in their online operations.Liz Hillock, head of online at Woolworths, said: "I wouldn't say e-commerce retailers are wholly dependent on established players to achieve scale, but the established retailers will definitely help to attract more consumers online."Therefore, the more retailers regardless of size that offer quality online shopping experiences the better, as this will drive a positive contribution to the entire e-commerce ecosystem," she said.Neil Schreuder, Shoprite Checkers marketing director, said the group was "closely watching the small but growing demand for online retailing in South Africa".Shoprite engages in e-commerce through its other businesses in categories where demand is high, such as online ticket and travel sales through Computicket and sales of furniture through House and Home and OK Furniture.It also offers business-to-business online ordering, and deliveries to the hospitality industry through its Checkers food services business.But Sebastien Delsemme, a consultant analyst at Kantar Retail, said the move to online was not simple "as there is a lot of work that needs to happen"."It's moving away from what we traditionally know and goes into the omni-channel, especially the online channel, which in South Africa is developing quite rapidly."Delsemme said the brick-and-mortar players would benefit from acquiring online operations by gaining access to their supply chain logistics.Despite South Africans being anxious about shopping online for security reasons, "I think it's something that we will see more. Woolworths is doing it well and Pick n Pay is doing it well, and Makro with their partnerships with petrol stations is doing it well," he said.But how keen are online retailers to become part and parcel of traditional retailers? Hoogduijn said: "Wherever a strategic partnership makes sense to accelerate growth and or reach, we will surely consider that."An IPO [initial public offering] is definitely not on our short- to mid-term road map at this stage. But if and when the time comes, I think the brand has enough equity to go IPO solo."tshandup@sundaytimes.com
