This is just a small sample of the brand's many well-priced goods, of which about 65% are imported from China.The Crazy Store, which is privately owned by 21 shareholders, opened its 300th store last month at Kyalami Corner Shopping Centre in Midrand and it plans to open another 20 stores by the end of the year.The brand is also set to expand elsewhere in Africa.It's about to open its 12th store in Namibia, where it has been operating since 2006, and is opening an outlet in Gaborone, Botswana.The company is also investigating the prospect of opening stores in Mozambique and Zambia.MD Kevin Lennett, commenting on the Midrand outlet, said "with the opening of this store, we cement our place as South Africa's largest trusted discount variety retailer".The Crazy Store's rapid growth is in stark contrast to the subdued retail operating environment in the country, where cash-strapped consumers face constraints on their disposable income and retailers are under pressure.Lennett said this week that it was a "highly successful business" and all expansion was funded by the business.He added that the challenging environment had benefited the brand, whose success he attributed to attaining the ideal balance between quality and price. "Continuing tough economic times have helped, rather than hurt, our growth.""Our buyers source product ranges with our target market carefully in mind. They have been very focused on stocking value-for-money goods."Stores, which are set up in areas where consumers in lifestyle measure six to 10 live or work, stock more than 4000 product lines. The 28 smaller express stores stock more than 2000 of the bestselling items."Trading densities are comparable with major national retailers," Lennett said, adding that customers from higher LSM brackets were increasingly discovering the store.The Crazy Store opened its first outlet, then known as the R10 Store, in Edenvale in 1995, and had 200 stores by 2011 in major urban centres, rural and semi-urban areas."What we've seen in recent times is definitely more affluent people shop at our stores." The challenge to having shops in upmarket retail areas such as Sandton or Cape Town's Waterfront would be the rentals."The average basket of goods is low so we would have to sell an extra amount of items to cover a high rental."Lennett sees competitors as fast-moving consumer goods companies, as well as the various plastic stores, toy stores - also the big Chinese malls and outlets, but to a lesser extent, "because we're national".The company operates in all provinces, with most of its stores located in Gauteng, followed by the Western Cape."We're trading well, probably a little bit ahead of the curve."We've got the right product at the right time, with the right comfort factor, at the right price," he said.
