The words appeared on the invitation like some test from the gods."No children under 16 allowed."Now as any parent of young offspring will tell you, there can be a lot of hand-wringing and heated debate when the prospect of a child-free weekend is on the table, especially if there are no relatives at hand.In the left corner, we had on offer: a luxurious tented camp in the Klein Karoo, guided sunrise hikes in the morning, amarula cream in the afternoon and delicious supper around a bushfire under the stars.In the right corner, we had: no cellphone reception, several hours from home, and children left in the care of unsuspecting friends who'd have no way of letting you know if, say, someone plummeted from a bunk bed.But let me tell you, you brave souls who have spawned the next generation, and I am going to say it only once: it was Just. The. Ticket.The very moment we were out of cellphone range and the tarred roads and traffic gave way to the bald beauty of the Klein Karoo, I handed myself over to this once-in-a-lifetime experience.The Explorer camp at Sanbona is an activity as much as it is a venue. For two days, you're taken into the care of an experienced guide and a camp assistant, who see to your every need and take you on the most magical game drives, walks and excursions.We arrived on Friday afternoon and parked at the designated spot inside the reserve. From there, a driver picked us up and drove for half an hour along the winding dirt roads of this colossal place. First stop: sundowners at one of the luxury lodges for those who have very deep pockets and also aren't as hellbent on having the "up close with nature" experience that the Explorer camp offers. En route from here to the next stop, we saw buffalo, kudu and giraffe.Second stop: an enchanting spot we'd call home for the next two days, deep in the heart of this beautifully eerie landscape.On that weekend, in terms of guests, it was just us two. But even at maximum capacity, it would only be six guests at a time.In other words, this isn't the sausage-machine safari you get at some of the day-trip game lodges nearer Cape Town. Imaging being surrounded by Klein Karoo landscape as far as the eye can see, but having at your disposal a hammock, a warm bed in a safe-as-houses tent, a toilet and shower out in nature (where the only way to know they're occupied is because someone has laid the log across the horns of the antelope skull on the path), a drinks cabinet, a "lounge" with cosy chairs and books.On the first night, we simply unwound around the campfire - with our lives and busy jobs in the CBD of Cape Town suddenly seeming like a strange and faraway place. The next morning, Casper Bester, our incredible guide, and Desmond Jagger, our leave-nothing-to-chance camp assistant, had us up and around the fire by 5am with some moerkoffie and rusks in preparation for the walk ahead.And what a walk it was!For the next four hours, while the sun slowly crept overhead pouring impossible shades of orange everywhere, we moved through the landscape.This isn't foot-stomping walking where you burn off the worries of the week and wonder how your bum muscles and legs are going to feel the next day.This is thoughtful walking through a landscape that seems desolate but is actually teeming with life - especially when you go down on your haunches and look into the lives of tiny little plants that have developed the most miraculous ways to survive the elements.Bester knows everything there is to know about every single plant and animal spoor, and it is such a delight to hear him explain it.And everything was so perfectly timed - by the time the sun was high enough to warrant sunblock and thirst, we were safely back at camp eating a delicious breakfast.Not bad, huh? To be home eating breakfast by 9am after a righteous bush walk that began at 5am.After that, like any wise animals in a hot habitat, we stayed in the shade - dozing off in the hammocks, reading a few pages of our books and saying, "Yes please," when offered a Savannah or beer.Later in the day, we went on a game drive, spotting plenty of zebra, giraffe, buck and birds along the way. A major highlight for me was getting close to a family of elephants, who had clearly just been lolling around in the warm mud and were now heading off slowly somewhere else.We ended up at the dam, where a boat safari and the most scrumptious lunch on board awaited us. Apart from the food, the delights here were the birdlife (the dam is a haven for birdwatchers) and the hippos.There was one heart-stopping moment, which I have to say was also a major highlight for me: we spotted a baby hippo not far from the boat, and then the mom spotted us spotting the baby, and she literally charged through the water to place herself between us and her offspring.It was the only time I saw our guide even slightly unnerved.After the long drive home, on which we saw lion, buck, zebra and giraffe, it was time for sundowners round the fire, followed by another hearty supper and a bit of stargazing.The following morning, we were up early again - this time for a much shorter walk followed by another game drive on which we were able to stand just metres away from a leopard with not a care in the world tucking into a carcass.We were also given a packed breakfast en route and were finally delivered safe and sound at our car, feeling tired in the best way possible, fulfilled, in awe of nature and simply damn lucky to have had this experience.What came next was something I wasn't prepared for: a world of schedules and skyscrapers, traffic jams, coffee shops and queues.Oh, and a little white lie. "Did you miss us, mom?""Yes, baby, every minute of every day. I would much rather have been looking for your school shoes and brushing knots from your golden tresses."RATES: Explorer Camp - from R4,100 per adult sharing per night.
