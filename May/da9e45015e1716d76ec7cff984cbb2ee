Have you ever watched one of those TV shows about off-grid living and wondered what it would be like?I decided to ease into off-grid living by checking into one of the new eco-cabins at Cape Nature's Grootvadersbosch Nature Reserve in the Langeberg mountains.To get there you head north up the N2 from Cape Town for a couple of hours, turn left at the sign for Suurbraak and head for the small village that sits on the banks of the Duivenhoksriver. I catch a glimpse of a tantalising caf called Paradise in Suurbraak, then push on to the reserve.The new cottages at Bushbuckridge are a kilometre or so from the main entrance and camping area and trickle down a slope, surrounded by forest alive with birdsong.They look a bit like treehouses with extensions on stilts - these are the braai rooms - fitted with blinds to keep out baboons.The hardship levels of off-grid living at Grootvadersbosch are low - cushions are squishy and the kitchens and bathrooms are gleaming with marble countertops and all mod cons.Designers working on the conversion of the 32 small cottages made the most of the natural environment, creating vistas where you least expect them. They whittled the number of buildings down to 11 and recycled many of the materials.Although the fridge runs off Eskom, the rest of the cottage's power needs are supplied by solar panels and a solar water geyser.</img>All the mod cons are there but, apart from one corner of Bushbuckridge, there is no cellphone reception.

Image: Supplied I'm here for some serious reading and relaxation, but on a more active weekend you can choose between two walks, the Bushbuck (10km) and the Grysbok (15km) trails, plus two bird hides.If the bushes of Grootvadersbosch aren't remote enough for you it's possible to go off-off-grid in the adjacent Boosmansbos wilderness area (you will need a permit).After two days of peace, broken mainly by the sound of yellow- throated warblers, it's time to ease back into on-grid life so I stop in Suurbraak and take a seat at Paradise Organic Caf where the freshly picked organic salad I order is alive with fresh figs and pomegranate rubies.I have plenty of time on the drive back to Cape Town on the N2 to ponder the importance of peace and quiet and time to breathe. Grootvadersbosch Nature Reserve is part of the indigenous Afromontaine forest in the south-western Cape and a World Heritage Site.
