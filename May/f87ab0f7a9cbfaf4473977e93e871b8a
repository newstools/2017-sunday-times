Q. Some friends tell me that I will not be able to fly to or from the US with my Samsung A7 phone due to their overheating battery problems. Is this true? - Dudley RistowA. The Samsung Galaxy A7 is a different, newer model from the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, which was banned by several airlines late last year following numerous reports of the devices catching fire.The Note 7 ban has not been rescinded and airlines no longer advise on their ban as it's so well known. Most of the phones have been recalled. According to Samsung, more than 96% of all Note 7s sold in the US had been returned to them by January this year.You should have no problem with the A7 smartphone.
