The 32-year-old's time smashed the official mark of 2:02:57 set by fellow Kenyan Dennis Kimetto in Berlin in 2014, but will not enter the record books largely due to a non-compliant system of pacemaking."The is not the end of the attempt of runners on two hours," the Olympic champion said after the race, likening the challenge to climbing a tree."When you step on the branches ... immediately you go to the next one," he said. Simbine sets Doha alight by beating biggest names in his career yetKipchoge rated it as the finest performance in a career that includes a gold medal at the Rio Games last year and a personal best official time of 2:03:05, the third-fastest in history."This journey has been good, it has been hard, it has been seven months hard preparation."Kipchoge and the only other competitors, Eritrean Zersenay Tadese and Ethiopian Lelisa Desisa, ran behind an arrow-head formation of pacemakers, to reduce drag, and a car beaming a green line on the road behind it to show the required speed for the sub-two hour target.Amid deep scepticism, Nike pitched the attempt as sport's "moon shot", with a keen eye on sales of its running shoes. It designed a lightweight shoe, Zoom Vaporfly Elite, with a carbon-fibre insole as part of the meticulous preparations.Nike's archrival, German firm Adidas, also has its own 'Sub2' project, also with a new shoe.In 2014, Runners World magazine predicted a sub-two under normal race conditions would not happen until 2075, based on analysis of more than 10,000 top marathon performances.The race began in pre-dawn gloom at a brutal speed behind pacemakers, who were world-class runners in their own right, including former world champion middle-distance runner Bernard Lagat of the United States.A total of 30 pacemakers split into groups of six, taking turns to set a tempo in a race run 63 years to the day after Briton Roger Bannister became the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes.The 35-year-old Tadese, the oldest competitor yesterday, finished in 2:06:51, followed by the youngest, 26-year-old Desisa, in 2:14:10.
