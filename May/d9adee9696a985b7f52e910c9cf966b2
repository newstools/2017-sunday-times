Here's how to remedy this and other common mistakes to ensure you get the biggest health boost from each sip.Mistake 1: not keeping it simpleThere is a tendency to add the contents of the fridge and every superfood to smoothies, but simple combinations are easier for the body to process.Mistake 2: using the same ingredients all the timeRotate what goes into your smoothies. This will keep things interesting and ensure a broad nutrient intake. Include seasonal fruits while they are at their nutritional peak.Millennials power up on 'hyper-functional' snacksMistake 3: drinking it coldAn excess of very cold foods can weaken digestion in the long run. Enjoy iced smoothies sparingly, especially in cooler weather. Let fridge-stored smoothies reach room temperature before drinking.Mistake 4: not adding a fibre boosterPart of the magic of fibre is that it slows digestion, leaving you satisfied for longer. Blitzing smoothies reduces the efficacy of fibre by breaking it down. Add additional fibre (like flax or chia seeds) to keep you regular, and keep hunger at bay.Mistake 5: not chewing your drinkResist the urge to glug that smoothie down. Digestion begins in the mouth and it is important to savour each mouthful. Not only is this gentler on the belly, but can make nutrients more readily available.
