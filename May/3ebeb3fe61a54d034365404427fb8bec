African artists account for just 0.01% of the international art market, but the auctioneers are confident that they are tapping into a fast-growing market.On Tuesday, 115 artworks by 63 artists of 14 countries across the African continent will be going under the hammer.They include works by Ghana's El Anatsui and William Kentridge and Irma Stern of South Africa, all of whom have sold for more than $1-million before."Sotheby's has been watching this market grow for several years," said Hannah O'Leary, head of modern and contemporary African art at the auction house established in 1744."We're on the verge of African art finally being acknowledged and represented in the international art scene. In recent years, I've seen an exponential increase in market demand," she said.The sale is expected to fetch 2.8-million to 4-million (about R48-million to R70-million).The main countries represented are South Africa and Nigeria. Other countries of origin include Angola, Mali and Uganda.Six of the artists have never had their work sold in an auction before. "There's a real gulf in representation of Africa in the art market that really needs to be addressed," O'Leary said."There are great opportunities, while the market is young, to really start collecting in this field."This auction has really caused a lot of excitement in the international art world."The highest-priced artwork is Anatsui's Earth Developing More Roots (2011), a large-scale hanging sculpture made from discarded foil bottleneck wrappers and copper wire.It is expected to fetch between 650000 and 850000.Francisco Vidal's Icarus Chocolate (2013), valued at between 15000 and 20000, is painted directly onto machetes, one of the symbols on the Angolan flag.Crash Willy (2009) by the Nigerian-British artist Yinka Shonibare depicts a headless driver lying across the back of a vintage car, its window pane broken and its wheels coming off. It is set to fetch between 120000 and 180000.Presale exhibitions have been held in Paris, Johannesburg, Cape Town, New York and London.
