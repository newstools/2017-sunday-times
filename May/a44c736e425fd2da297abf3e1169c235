STYLEClassic, colonial, with high, sprawling staircases, tall columns, massive flower arrangements in the foyer . this is a grandiose offering.The intimate pool area has striped deck chairs under palms, which have a South of France sort of feel, but with the mountain backdrop bringing it home to Cape Town. Tapas and sundowners are a must here.SERVICEThese good people remember your name and take the time to drop off sweets and nuts for your young companions in your room ahead of your arrival, along with a soft toy rhino and rooibos body butter.Good parking assistance, the restaurant service was exceptional and the spa assistants are accommodating of guests' hectic schedules, which are par for the course at this hotel catering to busy bees, in and out for work purposes.DININGBreakfasts are as lavish as they come. No caviar, but you won't want for anything else.For lunches and dinners, have the buffet (with Cape cuisine and continental standards, such as roasts and trimmings, done really well) or fancier la carte offerings at the Peach Tree Restaurant.We also tried the in-room dining and what was under the cloche was spectacular, down to the little butter dish and sauces accompanying our lamb chops. Still that's to be expected, given executive chef Henrico Grobbelaar's long list of accolades.ACTIVITIESThere is the on-site Mangwanani Spa and a regular shuttle to the V&amp;A Waterfront. Of course, you have all that Cape Town has to offer on your doorstep.BEST TIME TO GOAll year round.
