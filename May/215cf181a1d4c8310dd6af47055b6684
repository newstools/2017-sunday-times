Barbara Hutchison told the ASA that she measured the contents of five-litre boxes of Namaqua Wines Extra Lite and found they contained between four and 4.5litres.Namaqua refused to respond to the complaint, saying it was not a member of the ASA and did not submit to its jurisdiction. But the ASA decided to make a ruling because Namaqua is a member of the Industry Association for Responsible Alcohol Use, which has signed up to the advertising code."Given [Namaqua's] refusal to engage or to counter the complaint, [we] have no alternative but to find that the claim of containing 'five litres' creates a misleading impression," it said. It ordered Namaqua to drop the claim from its packaging.Namaqua Wines marketing co-ordinator Annelie Visagie referred Sunday Times queries to CEO Dani l van den Heever, but he did not respond. The company's lawyer, Johannes Spamer, was also unavailable.
