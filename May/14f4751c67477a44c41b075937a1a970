These fears have not actually been realised.But a new report into the publishing industry suggests that the era of a boxset generation may finally have heralded the demise of fiction.Spend on fiction books has dropped by nearly a quarter in Western countries in the past five years, the Publishers Association reported, as novels fight for people's limited leisure time in a world of television, the internet and social media.Readers seem also to be falling out of love with the novel in favour of non-fiction.Specialist food mags carve out a niche by serving up the bonkers & the sublimeContinuing a trend from 2015, digital sales once again fell as physical books increased, helped by diet books, cookery books, biographies and the remains of the adult colouring book craze.Stephen Lotinga, CE of the Publishers Association, said the fall in fiction was in part down to a lack of one stand-out bestseller last year, as well as the drop in digital sales affecting novels more than non-fiction titles.Fiction had suffered as a result of competition from other leisure activities including television, films and the constant use of screens even outside the home."There has been a trend, and it's one that the industry is aware of," Lotinga said. "Fiction books in particular are one of those areas where we're basically competing for people's time."We're up against a whole load of other media and formats. It's one of those things people particularly use in their leisure time and we're competing for that."We know not just from our own data but other data out there that people feel they have less free time than they've ever had before. So that's something fiction is suffering from."Lotinga said television had become "incredibly accessible", adding: "People are carrying screens around with them all the time. There is a lot of competition for people's time from a lot of leisure activities, and particularly those that lend themselves to people sitting in their homes."Talking about the Publishers Association annual report overall, he said: "People's habits are changing. Non-fiction has had an incredibly good year. Audio book sales have been on the rise."Children's books, which largely eschewed the digital craze, rose, helped by the popularity of David Walliams' titles.In non-fiction Joe Wicks' Lean in 15 books led the way, becoming the bestselling diet books since records began. - The Daily Telegraph This article was originally published in The Times.
