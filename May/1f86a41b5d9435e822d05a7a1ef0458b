The tournament in England smashed all previous records despite the hosts' pool-stage exit, generating more than 150-million for World Rugby and profit of 26-million for the Rugby Football Union (RFU).The host country's only means of revenue are from ticket sales, and the RFU's profit came from setting a record of more than 2.47million sales for the 48 matches in 13 venues across England and Wales. Nerves on edge as Boks head for 'group of death'Japan has a more modest target for ticket sales of between 1.6million-1.8million, and even with increased prices it will be difficult for the Japanese union to match the figure the RFU gained.But significantly the 2019 tournament is due to see another rise in the commercial value of the broadcasting rights and sponsorship, which should ensure that it raises the overall financial worth of the tournament to World Rugby.Several high-profile sponsor partners have been confirmed recently and at least four more are expected before the end of this year.Japan will have to pay a tournament fee of 96-million to World Rugby to host the tournament, an increase of 20% from the 80-million that England had to guarantee to World Rugby to be hosts in 2015.Japan's victory over Samoa was watched by a record national television audience of 25million viewers during the tournament in England.Japan has yet to finalise their ticketing structure - the match schedule will be published in September and tickets are set to go on sale in early 2018 - but prices are certain to rise.Since 2015, Japan has seen its rugby fan-base rise by 11million, while 400,000 visitors are expected for the tournament.
