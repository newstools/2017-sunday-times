Highlanders 44 - Waratahs 28They were trailing 14-13 at half-time, giving the Waratahs hope of becoming the first Australian team to win in New Zealand this year.But when Waratahs lock Dean Mumm was sin-binned early in the second half, the Highlanders scored two tries with their one-man advantage, and they never looked back.It moved the Highlanders to 10 wins from 13 matches and left the Tahs with only four wins from 12.Highlanders captain Ben Smith said the sending-off of Mumm for a tip tackle had been the turning point for his side. "We got momentum then and we managed to score from that lineout and things changed from there," Smith said."We knew they were going to bring that intensity early on and we just knew that if we could stick at it there might be chances later on."The Waratahs arrived in Dunedin buoyed by their 50-23 win over the Melbourne Rebels last week and skipper Michael Hooper said they had only themselves to blame for the form reversal."Discipline killed us. Against a team like the Highlanders they took their opportunities well and their second half was fantastic. Discipline is the main area to work on," he said.Marty Banks, the most accurate marksman in the competition this year, gave the Highlanders the early lead with a penalty.It was extended to 10-0 when he converted a try by Richard Buckman, who had pounced on the ball after Luke Whitelock charged down a Bernard Foley clearing kick. Replays suggested Buckman may have been offside, but the television match official gave him the benefit of the doubt.Israel Folau put the Waratahs on the board with a try from the resumption of play, and after Banks's second penalty for the Highlanders, Taqele Naiyaravoro scored on the stroke of halftime with Foley's conversion putting them ahead.Tries by Liam Coltman and Tevita Li, when Mumm was off the field, took the sting out of the Waratahs and a Rob Thompson try extended the Highlanders' lead to 30-14.The Waratahs came back with two late tries by replacement Jake Gordon, but these were matched by tries from Daniel Lienert-Brown and Lima Sopoaga for the Highlanders.Sunwolves 7 - Cheetahs 47Flanker Uzair Cassiem scored two tries as the Cheetahs put the Sunwolves to the sword with a six-try victory in Tokyo to record their third win of the season yesterday.Cassiem burrowed over for the first time in the 16th minute, loose-forward Niell Jordaan added the second just before halftime and flyhalf Niel Marais finished off a flowing move at the start of the second half.Sunwolves lock Sam Wykes burst through a tackle to cut the deficit to 19-7 in the 47th minute but Cassiem crashed over for his second 13 minutes from the whistle.There was still time for hooker Torsten van Jaarsveld to cross before replacement back Tian Meyer and winger Sergeal Petersen put a gloss on the win.
