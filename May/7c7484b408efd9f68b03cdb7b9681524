This was revealed yesterday by Trevor Manuel, who told the audience at the Kader Asmal memorial lecture at the University of Cape Town that Asmal had nominated Ramaphosa ahead of the Polokwane conference in 2007, at which Mbeki was defeated by President Jacob Zuma."Ahead of the 52nd conference in 2007, comrade Kader, probably in Gaby Shapiro branch, nominated Cyril Ramaphosa for president and he didn't make any secret about this. Nor did he make any secret about the fact that the election of Jacob Zuma would set back the ANC and the country, and we needed to exercise extreme caution."He made no bones about this a decade ago. [The] appropriate candidate to succeed Thabo Mbeki would have been Cyril Ramaphosa ... Ramaphosa backers want him to quit cabinet"Kader had no compunction telling the world that - and, if there are younger people in the audience, forgive me, I am quoting - 'Cyril Ramaphosa has no b****.'"Asked by an audience member whether Manuel believed Ramaphosa had no "b****", Manuel jokingly said he was not a "urologist", a response that was met with laughter.Manuel also questioned the "very strange" intelligence report Zuma reportedly relied on to fire Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas.The lecture, organised by the ANC's Gaby Shapiro branch, was themed "moral courage and ethical leadership in the ANC". Manuel said the judiciary was the country's last line of defence and had to be respected.Under normal circumstances, somebody should have resigned after the Constitutional Court delivered judgment in the Nkandla case and found against Zuma and parliament, said Manuel."On Thursday past, the High Court [in Pretoria] made a rather interesting interlocutory finding about the reason for the last reshuffle."It's an interesting one because what may emerge ... is a very strange intelligence report that found its way - and some people have taken ownership of this report - into the public domain," he said.
