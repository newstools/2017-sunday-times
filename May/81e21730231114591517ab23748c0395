We put out a call to readers to be part of the panel of tasters. Forty of them came together on a Saturday morning at the HTA Culinary School in Randburg, Johannesburg, to taste ready-made garlic breads from four leading supermarkets.Chef Kabelo Segone, assisted by chefs Lerato Maake, Levy Pelele and Refilwe Makatu, prepared the food as per package instructions.The panel of tasters were presented with each of the products "naked" without any branding or packaging. The garlic breads were judged on appearance, quality of the bread, taste, the filling (butter or margarine?) and the amount of garlic used.Auditor Jade Craig was on hand to monitor the objectivity of the blind-tasting process, from removing the packaging to numbering the products, overseeing the preparation and adding up the score sheets.Judges' comments:"Lovely appearance, great taste and enough garlic.""Big on taste, lovely buttery filling with the right balance of garlic and herbs.""Good quality of bread and real butter. It has a nice crispness to it."Price: R19.99 Judges' comments:"Quality of the bread is very good but too little garlic and butter is too salty.""There was too much butter which made it soggy and bread quality is average.""There s lots of lovely butter but needs more garlic."Price: R36.99Judges' comments:"It is very oily, soggy and does not taste good.""I don t think this is butter but margarine as it did not melt well. Garlic bread should be made with butter.""Too much margarine, little garlic, very salty and the bread was doughy."Price: R19.99 Judges' comments:"Can t taste the garlic.""Bread nice and light.""It tastes like they used olive oil.""Below average. Bread could be better."Price: R19.90
