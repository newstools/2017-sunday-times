Durban has long been one of the regions on our list of targets We re extremely excited to see how it s received and have high hopes that Durban will be the second of many. The board features 22 properties and Osborne said they could include shopping spots educational facilities and even sport stadiums. I m sure that the home of the Sharks will get more than a few nominations. Five thousand copies of Durban will be made for the initial run and Osborne was confident that they would sell. Why play on someone else s streets? Yes it s a nice gift for tourists but we think that this will mainly appeal to Durbanites.
