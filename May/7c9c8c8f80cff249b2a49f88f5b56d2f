After studying data for 128 fathers, and accounting for factors like their income and age, researchers from Imperial College London, King's College London and Oxford University found that even from three months of age, father-child interactions can positively predict cognitive development almost two years later. Researchers filmed parents playing with their children (without toys) at three months, and then again during a book-reading session at two years old. The videos were then analyzed independently by trained researchers to grade the fathers on their interactions.The risks of having grandparents raise their grandchildrenAt two years of age, the scientists scored the babies' cognitive development using the standardized Bayley mental development index (MDI), which involves tasks such as recognizing colors and shapes.The study found a positive correlation between the degree to which dads engaged with their babies and how the children scored on the tests. Babies whose dads had less positive outlooks, or who were more withdrawn and depressive in their interactions, had lower scores at 24 months. Conversely, children whose fathers were more engaged and sensitive, or those who were less controlling in their interactions, scored higher, irrespective of the mother's level of sensitivity.The impact was also found to be equal for boys and girls.Dr. Vaheshta Sethna from King's College London, said: "We also found that children interacting with sensitive, calm and less anxious fathers during a book session at the age of two showed better cognitive development, including attention, problem-solving, language and social skills. This suggests that reading activities and educational references may support cognitive and learning development in these children." The study is available here.
