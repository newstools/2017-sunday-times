The South Africans rebounded from last week's shock loss to the Southern Kings to register their eighth win of the season and secure a vital bonus point to surge seven points clear of the Auckland Blues, their closest challengers for the last wildcard into the play-offs.Despite being decimated by injuries and playing in the stifling humidity of Southeast Asia for the first time, the Sharks dominated the match from the outset, racking up six tries, three by elusive fullback Mvovo as well as two from winger S'busiso Nkosi and one from towering lock Ruan Botha. Sharks rip Sunwolves apart in Singapore to edge closer to playoff berth The Sunwolves threw caution to the wind in the hope of getting their second win of the season but their inexperience in Super Rugby was once again exposed.While they showed some flashes of individual brilliance, the second-year franchise undid a lot of their good work by coughing up too much possession and making bad decisions at critical times.Trailing by 21-7 at half time, the Sunwolves got to within four points of the Sharks late in the second half as the visitors started to show signs of weariness but dropped the ball inside their own 22 after a risky cross-kick and then gave up three quick tries to remain rooted to the bottom of the standings.

Otago Highlanders prop Aki Seiuli scored two tries as they completed a rousing 55-6 bonus-point victory over Western Force in their Super Rugby clash in Perth yesterday.The eight-try romp saw wing Tevita Li, fullback Patrick Osborne and his replacement Rob Thompson (two), flank Dillon Hunt and centre Richard Buckman also cross the whitewash.The Highlanders have now moved 10 points clear of the Auckland Blues in the fourth play-off spot in the New Zealand Conference after 12 matches, significantly boosting their chances of making the knockout stages.The victory is an eighth in succession for the 2015 Super Rugby champions, who had started the campaign miserably with three defeats in their opening four games.
