The author of Story of an African Farm was something of a Karoo wanderer in her adulthood, spending time in dorps such as Hanover, Barkly East, Matjiesfontein and Kimberley.Cradock, however, is the heart of any literary trail that honours her. 10 epic trips for book loversHer house at No 9 Cross Street - where she lived briefly from 1868-1870 - is a national monument and now houses a museum devoted to her life and works.She was buried in the same grave as her infant daughter and little dog on a mountaintop at Buffelshoek, near Cradock.It is a stiff hike to the top but worth it for the fine views over the Karoo. Access, however, is on private land - ask for details at the museum.

The Information Centre, phone 083-272-2958 or 014-503-0085 or e-mail info@marico.co.za.There's no trail for Alan Paton but you can visit one of Cry, The Beloved Country's most evocative characters - the narrow-gauge railway, wonderfully described in the opening pages of the novel: "It is interesting to wait for the train at Carisbrooke while it climbs out of the great valley.Those who know can tell you with each whistle where it is, at what farm, what road, what river."The railway, saved from scrap by local businessman Julian Pereira, runs regular trains up the hill from Ixopo to Carisbrooke, sometimes using one of the very steam engines that Paton would have seen.The mist still swirls through the wattles and you still glimpse arum lilies in a dell as you puff up the hill.
