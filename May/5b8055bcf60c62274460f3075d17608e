Grobler uses 13 gin botanicals the bulk of which are sourced from Europe combined with African botanicals used in traditional healing. A few of these unique botanicals are sourced from the Faraday Muthi Market in the Joburg CBD. The inclusion of these local botanicals gives our gin a distinctive taste and smell. Grobler said the local gin scene is still in its infancy. Small breweries and distilleries locally are slowly and steadily gaining momentum as demand grows she said. TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
