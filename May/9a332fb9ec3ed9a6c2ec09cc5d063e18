The deal, announced last year and finalised this month, comes after its acquisition in March of Kenya-based PineBridge Investments East Africa Limited, and the purchase of a 40% stake in the Zimnat Group in Zimbabwe in 2015. The Saham deal, valued at $329-million (R4.3-billion), comes a little more than a year after Sanlam and its short-term insurance subsidiary, Santam, bought a 30% stake in the Morocco-based insurer in February 2016.Insurance industry experts see the expansion beyond South Africa's borders as the next frontier for locally based insurance groups, which are facing cut-throat competition in the insurance sector and weak economic growth in South Africa.Gerdus Dixon, the national head of insurance at KPMG, said: "Expansion into other African territories has been on the board agendas of South African insurance groups for a number of years. These territories offer substantial growth opportunities and better profit margins to boost earnings."However, over the past two years there has been a shift in focus. "Against the backdrop of muted in-country growth African insurance groups are now integrating their existing investments across the continent rather than looking for the next big acquisition," said Dixon. "The focus is on building scale, improving the control and governance structures and better pricing and capital management within the African portfolios. "The mantra is for subsidiaries in the rest of Africa to add to group profitability in the short to medium term, rather than being a detractor," said Dixon. Junior Ngulube, CEO of Sanlam Emerging Markets, said the latest transaction confirmed Sanlam's commitment to strengthening its strategic partnerships."Having identified strong synergies between the Sanlam and Saham Groups, we are committed to unlocking additional collaborations together through our collective skills and network capabilities across Africa."We believe this holds significant mutual benefits for the two groups and it will also benefit our stakeholders," Ngulube said.The transaction, which got regulatory approval earlier this month, was funded from internal cash resources. Of the 46.6% Sanlam holds in Saham Finances, Sanlam Emerging Markets would hold 85% and Santam 15%. Saham Finances recorded turnover of more than $1-billion in 2015 and has a growth strategy slanted towards Africa and the Middle East. It operates through its subsidiaries, which include 34 insurance and reinsurance companies across 700 branches throughout Africa, and has a team of more than 3000 collaborators. Sanlam's foothold in Africa was also boosted in March when it increased its stake in PineBridge Investments East Africa Limited , an asset-management company with operations in Kenya and Uganda. Anthony King, the regional CEO at PineBridge Investments, said it had looked for a partner in Africa who could best continue to work with its clients on the continent."Sanlam is a respected brand with a compelling regional footprint that will offer financial strength and further access to local investment opportunities," he said.In March, Sanlam's unit in Zimbabwe, Zimnat Group, completed a rebranding exercise to show off its association to its South African partner. Sanlam purchased its 40% stake in the Zimnat Group in 2015 for $11.6-million.Companies with operations in Zimbabwe face an uphill task as they battle a severe liquidity crunch, a fall in the disposable income of consumers and a rise in inflationary pressures - which pose a significant threat to profitability and return on investment.Thabied Majal, group executive for corporate affairs at Sanlam Emerging Markets, said in an e-mailed response to questions that Sanlam believed the "long-term fundamentals" for doing business in Zimbabwe were good, despite current economic pressures."Sanlam remains optimistic about the prospects of Zimbabwe's insurance industry, which is expected to show reasonable growth in the years to come in both the life and non-life sectors."Sanlam is also optimistic about Zimnat's continued stable and profitable growth during prolonged volatile economic circumstances, which was once again evident in Sanlam's 2016 annual results ... announced in March."Sanlam believes it has found a partner that shares its vision and looks forward to continue sharing technical expertise and collaborating with Zimnat to grow this business," Majal said.In posting results for the year to December 2016, Sanlam said that its new business volumes had increased 11% to R233-billion and that Sanlam Emerging Markets had outperforming targets for the year.
