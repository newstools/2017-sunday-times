In fact, that may remain the case next season unless he opts out of his contract with the Japanese club NTT Docomo Red Hurricanes, whom he joined last season.Whiteley, who this week was installed as the 58th Springbok captain for next month's three-test series against France, has been receiving a match fee in the 15 tests he has played to date.He doesn't hold a so-called "tripartite contract" - an agreement between a player, SA Rugby and the local franchise the player represents.Before the 2015 Rugby World Cup (RWC), SA Rugby entered into 15 tripartite agreements with players they believed would represent the country over the ensuing four years.SA Rugby haven't added to that list. "That's about all SA Rugby can afford at the moment," a SA Rugby source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Sunday Times.Approached for comment, Whiteley said he would prefer not to.His situation may yet come under review. It is unlikely that Springbok head coach Allister Coetzee would have offered him the leadership role without addressing the terms of Whiteley's appointment.SA Rugby's ability to contract players could, however, improve dramatically if rumours that MTN are about to become team sponsors are true.The telecommunications giant will apparently come on board before the series kicks off against France.It will no doubt leave rivals and SA Rugby associate sponsors Vodacom, spitting mad.Even if the new deal riles one of their long-term partners, SA Rugby is in no position to turn sponsors down.How it will affect Whiteley's situation remains to be seen.The 29-year old's contract with the Lions expires next year but he will more than likely stay there if he continues to lead the Boks.If a Bok contract is not forthcoming this year, Whiteley will probably continue playing in Japan. SA Rugby would discourage that but the player would be left little option.In his contractual deliberations, Whiteley has a young family to consider. His wife is expecting their second child on the eve of the first test against France next month.The amiable No8 is unlikely to force the issue with SA Rugby. For the moment, he will be only too pleased to lead the Boks.Even if MTN comes on board, it doesn't mean Whiteley would be offered a contract that stretches until after the next World Cup.As one source put it: "It is difficult to say. There are so many variables we are dealing with. He is the captain of South Africa but he was only appointed until the end of June. He is still contracted in Japan for next season so his status could probably only change in 2019."The bulk of the players who concluded tripartite deals are contracted until after the 2019 RWC.Those deals were made in 2015 by SA Rugby's erstwhile general manager of rugby, Rassie Erasmus and then Bok coach Heyneke Meyer.
