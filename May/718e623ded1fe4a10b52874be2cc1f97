Hotel living has never been my favourite as I find they are often cold, crowded and soulless. But I am happy to say this is slowly changing with an influx of small and quaint boutique hotels that focus on comfort and making one feel at home.Being an avid Instagrammer, especially when it comes to interiors and design, I came across this little hotel in central Paris that resonated with me as it reminded me of my own home and personal taste. I simply had to experience it for myself.It is, as Pauline d'Hoop and Delphine Sauvaget, recently graduated interior design duo from Favorite Agency, describe it: "A family home, but one you never want to leave; a place where each object is carefully chosen so that everyone will feel at home."Hotel C.O.Q is their first project and they have managed to create a space that utilises the latest trends without making it feel pretentious or over the top. They have also provided a welcome and warmth unlike any other hotel I have ever stayed in. Their combination of nostalgic accents combined with a modern French bohemia have made every space a visual delight.The 50 rooms are all different; each one beautifully designed for comfort with a combination of soft, rich hues, luxurious textures and elegant practicality. Every detail, from pillow size to lighting to soundproofing and bathroom amenities, was carefully considered.The attention to detail makes the hotel's name "Community Of Quality" (COQ) ring true in every sense, from the friendly staff and delicious food (only the freshest local farm produce is used) to the lounging nooks brought to life with plants - a choice setting for solo reflection or relaxing with friends. The perfect Parisian home away from home!A post shared by C.O.Q Hotel Paris (@coqhotelparis) on Jan 29, 2017 at 2:31am PST A post shared by C.O.Q Hotel Paris (@coqhotelparis) on Feb 9, 2017 at 11:59pm PST A post shared by C.O.Q Hotel Paris (@coqhotelparis) on Feb 11, 2017 at 6:56am PST A post shared by C.O.Q Hotel Paris (@coqhotelparis) on May 6, 2017 at 8:27am PDT A post shared by C.O.Q Hotel Paris (@coqhotelparis) on Apr 25, 2017 at 2:50am PDT
