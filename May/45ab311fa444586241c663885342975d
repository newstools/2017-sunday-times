Coetzee's ghastly record last year - eight defeats in 12 tests was well below par - has given rise to speculation the guillotine will be wheeled into place should the Springboks come up short against France.France didn't prove their Waterloo, but Ian McIntosh and Harry Viljoen know what it feels like not to win a home series against France.Like those who struggle to stay afloat lose sight of land, Coetzee, who describes France as the most improved international team, cannot lose sight of the 2019 Rugby World Cup (RWC). His time spent as Jake White's assistant between 2004 and 2007 would have taught him the value of building a team and letting it grow as a collective.He, however, again starts on the back foot. He has recalled all of last year's underperformers, bar Lions scrumhalf Faf de Klerk.To be fair, Coetzee's hands are partially tied as SA Rugby has financially committed to half the potential World Cup squad. As a result, the coach has been partially guided by his predecessor Heyneke Meyer and the former general manager of rugby at SA Rugby, Rassie Erasmus, who contracted players before the last RWC with a view to retaining them for the 2019 edition.The timing may seem peculiar, but at the time the air was thick with the possibility of a post-World Cup player exodus. Also, in the corridors of power it was generally accepted that Meyer would remain coach after the 2015 World Cup. About 15 players had been contracted for that purpose.All of this leaves Coetzee with little room to manoeuvre. Last year's underperformers are now part of Coetzee's reality. It is not as if SA Rugby can contract widely outside that group. "SA Rugby doesn't have money to contract more players," a SA Rugby source said.Should Coetzee remain loyal to the players Meyer bequeathed him, his search would be confined to finding the other half of the World Cup squad for 2019.That list of course now excludes Adriaan Strauss who opted to retire from international rugby at the end of last season.Still, players like Eben Etzebeth, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Lood de Jager, Coenie Oosthuizen, Pat Lambie, Handre Pollard, Jesse Kriel, Damian de Allende, Frans Malherbe, Siya Kolisi, Tendai Mtawarira, Jesse Kriel and Jan Serfontein can be reasonably assumed to occupy the inside lane to go all the way to the next World Cup.Rugby's high rate of attrition, however, makes it highly unlikely that all of them will make it to Japan.Super Rugby has thrown up options which will challenge the wisdom that was applied by Meyer almost two years ago.Warren Whiteley has been installed as Springbok captain for the series against France, while some of his Lions teammates have surged to the front of the rugby public's consciousness. Elton Jantjies has been consistent, Malcolm Marx and Ruan Dreyer were two-thirds of a redoubtable first choice front row, while Jaco Kriel and Franco Mostert just keep on trucking.At the back, Courtnall Skosan has played out of his socks, Andries Coetzee has hardly put a foot wrong, and Ross Cronj , who for so long has operated in De Klerk's shadow, is now basking in the glow of the green and gold. Elsewhere, the Sharks' Lukhanyo Am can now also look forward to a lengthy spell in the Bok jersey. The energy and enthusiasm with which he has occupied the No13 jersey has only enhanced his credentials.The Cheetahs' Ox Nch was a surprise exclusion from the Springbok squad, especially as Lizo Gqoboka cracked the nod ahead of him. Nch , however, is in the SA A squad and his surge for higher honours will come sooner rather than later.The same goes for Curwin Bosch whose path to the highest level is now dotted with must-visit landmarks.Players like Rohan Janse van Rensburg, Jean-Luc du Preez and RG Snyman will come into the reckoning once injury and suspension have yielded.In addition, Steven Kitshoff is considered a local again, while players like Frans Steyn, Francois Hougaard and Duane Vermeulen provide insurance.sports@timesmedia.co.za
