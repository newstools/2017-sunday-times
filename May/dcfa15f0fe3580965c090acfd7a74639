Locked in place with hurricane-proof anchors, horizontal ropes sunk below the surface of the sea form the layered framework of Smith's three-dimensional ocean farm. Streamers of kelp grow downwards, scallops hang in nets and mussels in special socks, with oysters in cages below. Clams grow under the mud on the sea floor."We went 3D and started growing a whole mix of species - but only species that you don't have to feed; that are zero input."So no fresh water, no fertiliser, no feed, which makes it the most affordable food to grow," said Smith, who dropped out of school at the age of 14 to work on industrial ships hoovering up vast quantities of fish, sometimes illegally.Kelp sucks up five times more carbon than land-based plants while oysters can filter 189 litres of water a day, said Smith.The easily assembled underwater farms are also a magnet for fish and help regenerate reefs.

It's the beginning of an entirely new culinary adventure," he said.Alongside GreenWave, which trains farmers and provides seeds and equipment, a separate company takes responsibility for processing plants and market development for the ocean farms, promising to buy 80% of the produce at triple the market rate, selling the shellfish and kelp to local restaurants and other businesses.A World Bank report last year said global food security could be strengthened by large-scale seaweed production for human and animal use. An increase to 500,000 billion dry-weight kilograms a year by 2050 could boost the world's food supply by 10%, it said.Massive seaweed farming expansion could help tropical developing countries reduce poverty and climate change-linked migration, and improve their ecosystem management, it added.Growing seaweed in polluted waters can also soak up contaminants and later potentially be used to generate energy."We need to farm our way into a new economy and into a new revived ecology," said Smith . - Reuters This article was originally published in The Times.
