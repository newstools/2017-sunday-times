The ANC says it will instruct Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown to reverse the decision when she appears before the party's top leaders at Luthuli House tomorrow.Party spokesman Zizi Kodwa said the party was "disappointed and embarrassed" by Brown's endorsement of the Eskom board's decision to re-appoint Molefe to his old position.The board offered Molefe his job back after Brown had blocked a R30-million pension payout to Molefe.Molefe had left Eskom under a dark cloud in November last year after the public protector's State of Capture report revealed that he had relations with the controversial Gupta family.Molefe was then parachuted into parliament, in what was seen as a move to prepare him for the finance ministry post. But ANC and SACP leaders blocked his appointment when Pravin Gordhan was removed.
