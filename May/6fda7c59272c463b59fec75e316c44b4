So, to stand a chance of being accommodated in No1's camp in December, Mbete has appointed herself the Nkandla Crooner's chief imbongi. But because No1's preferred candidate, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, has hogged all the airtime, no one recognises this mampara any more. So yesterday she hijacked the funeral of 17 children who died in a horrific car crash in Bronkhorstspruit to attack South Africans who marched against No1.Shame on you, Madam Mampara.
