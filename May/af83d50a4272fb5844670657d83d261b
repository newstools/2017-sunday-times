The movie which, according to The Hollywood Reporter, also has director Ava DuVernay attached to helm and Insecure creator Issa Rae in talks to write is the brainchild of Twitter user @1800SADGAL, who posted an image of the Oscar and Grammy winners sitting front row at a 2014 Miu Miu fashion show (pictured above) with the caption, "Rihanna looks like she scams rich white men and lupita is the computer smart best friend that helps plan the scans [sic]."The post went viral - typo and all - and saw Nyong'o acknowledge the tweet about the potential film, writing: "I'm down if you are @rihanna". Rihanna responded: "I'm in Pit'z".Other users then suggested DuVernay and Rae should board the then-hypothetical film, and the rest is history. Netflix acquired the project out of the Cannes Film Festival, and DuVernay took to Twitter to promote the news.
