With United preparing to trigger the 85-million release clause in France striker Antoine Griezmann's contract with Atl tico Madrid following their Europa League triumph, Rooney seems braced to bring the curtain down on a glittering career at Old Trafford.Only hours after lifting the Europa Cup following United's 2-0 victory over Ajax Amsterdam in Stockholm, Rooney learnt that his England career was effectively over after 119 caps as Gareth Southgate dropped him from the squad to play Scotland and France next month.The 31-year-old had played what is likely to be his 559th and final game for United after coming on as a 90th-minute substitute against Ajax on Wednesday, and afterwards the club's record scorer revealed:He is close to a final decision over his future that he will communicate in the next couple of weeks;He doesn't need to hold further talks with manager Jos Mourinho, who has said he would be happy for the player to see out the final year of his 300000-a-week contract. He wants to play more regular football;He has "lots of offers" from England and clubs overseas but wouldn't play for a Premier League side other than United or Everton.Asked whether he would continue to be a part of United's plans, Rooney said: "Honestly, I don't know. I've got decisions to make now over the next few weeks, have a word with my family, and then I'll decide."But when pressed on whether he had already reached that decision, he replied: "More or less, yeah." Tellingly, Rooney said there was no need for further discussions with Mourinho. "No, I know. As the manager said before, he wants me to stay, but..."Everton have asked to be kept appraised of Rooney's situation as they consider a move to bring him back to Goodison Park, 13 years after he left as an 18-year-old in a 25.6-million deal. The player would have to take a huge cut in wages.It is understood there are no offers from other top-flight clubs in England, but he is continuing to attract interest from overseas. Several Chinese clubs are believed to be interested, while Major League Soccer in the US is an alternative.With United eager to sign Griezmann, likely to be one of up to four new arrivals at Old Trafford along with Burnley centrehalf Michael Keane, Rooney appears to recognise his chances are even more limited.While Southgate said the door would remain open, Rooney's omission from England's 25-man squad suggested more caps were unlikely.
