''Just as we don't have the same skin at 50 as we had at 25, the condition of our hair changes too," says trichologist Anabel Kingsley.''Post-partum hair loss, which occurs in about 50% of women, happens in the six to 12 weeks following birth and is due to hormonal changes taking place," she says. ''In some cases post-partum hair loss can trigger the hair-ageing process. It doesn't help that around the time women have children they often start getting less sleep and, if they're very busy or tired, start drinking more coffee, eating more sugar and skipping meals.Up your hair game with inspiration from trend-setting local celebs''If we're not eating properly it will show in our hair. Our body can survive without hair, so if your diet is poor, your hair is the last place to receive goodness."Kingsley says a good anti-ageing hair diet includes a palm-size amount of protein at every meal, plenty of fruit and vegetables, omega-3s (found in oily fish, nuts and seeds, and dark-green leafy vegetables), complex carbs like wholegrain breads, beans and oats, and starchy vegetables, such as potatoes and parsnips.As well as a good cut, colour is a crucial anti-ager.''As you get into your 30s and 40s, a rule of thumb is to go slightly lighter around your face," says hairstylist Melanie Smith. ''Dark hair around the face can pronounce dark under-eye circles and lines, so lighten one or two shades. If you're a brunette, ask for lighter brown highlights; if you're a blonde, ask for some warmth. And redheads should go for copper or golden tones around the face.''Kingsley says stress speeds up hair ageing. ''Stress also ages hair, and very quickly, because it affects the digestive system and the absorption of nutrients, leaving hair looking lacklustre and/or thinner." - The Daily Telegraph
