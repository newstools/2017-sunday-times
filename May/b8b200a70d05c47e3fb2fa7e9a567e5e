The minimum security measures are outlined in the Department of Basic Education's latest infrastructure safety and security guidelines, and are set to turn schools into fortresses in a bid to clamp down on crime, vandalism and damage caused by service-delivery protests.They apply to all new and revamped schools and include a 15m buffer zone between the fence and school building to "prevent projectiles such as petrol bombs and stones being thrown at windows".According to the 37-page document, it is more cost-effective to include security measures upfront than "to retrofit later when the inevitable has occurred". No ID book, no food for 'ghost pupils'Schools - plagued by serious crime including the murder of teachers and pupils, rape, assault and armed robbery - have increasingly become a soft target for criminals.The department's move to beef up security was sparked by a spike in the incidence of vandalism, including "a fashionable new wave of intentional burning of schools by general members of the public and learners", according to the guidelines.The vandalism and torching of more than 30 schools in Vuwani, Limpopo, last year provisionally cost taxpayers R720-million.The guidelines state that a 1.8m vandal-proof fence, which could be raised to 2.1m or 2.4m depending on a risk assessment of crime trends in the area, must be designed in such a way that it does not create a "prison-like" appearance. The blueprint for the new safety and security guidelines has been approved by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga and the nine provincial MECs.It includes constructing a thick slab of reinforced concrete above the ceilings of computer labs, strongrooms, printing rooms, server rooms and rooms where records are kept.In addition, the cavity between the inner and outer walls of computer rooms, multimedia centres, strongrooms and server rooms must be embedded with "high-security mesh". Alternatively, the brick walls of these rooms can be replaced with reinforced concrete walls.The guidelines contain detailed specifications for the fence, which include anti-cut, anti-climb and anti-burrow features. Surveillance cameras, protected by tamper-proof and anti-vandal glass, must be installed in reception areas as well as outside administration areas, in corridors and areas overlooking main entrances and playgrounds.</img>Maligana Secondary School was one of more than 30 schools burnt in Vuwanilast year.

Robb said the fact that the guidelines made no mention of how the measures would be funded was a serious red flag.</img>Staff and Learners at Maligana Secondary School attempt to clean burnt and vandalized buildings as schools in Limpopo's Vuwani Areas returned to class on Monday, May 16, 2016, following weeks of violence which saw more than 20 schools burnt.
