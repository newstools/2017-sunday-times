But they are wrong, according to Sinal Govender and Lovanya Moodley of law firm Norton Rose Fulbright.In fact, employees could face disciplinary action for their online comments or rants."This could be fatal to their employment. The reality is that with the escalating use of social media ... employees are regularly coming under fire for what they post online," Govender and Moodley warn.They have the following advice: Before posting on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or anywhere else, even if you're not the original poster and are simply sharing the post, ask yourself: "Does this post align with my company's values?" Be conscious of when you post and how much of each day is spent on social media. You are likely to get into trouble if you tell your boss you are too busy to take on a new project - and they can see you have spent most of your day on various social networking sites; Any unsavoury comments posted online that could negatively affect your employer's brand could result in disciplinary action; Ensure you understand your employer's social media policies and the consequences of breaching them; and Think twice, or even more often, before you comment on a post. A good rule of thumb is: "If you wouldn't place it on a billboard, you shouldn't be posting it online," say Govender and Moodley.
