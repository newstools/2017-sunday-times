WhereIsMyTransport compiles information on the routes of minibus taxis, tuk-tuks or rickshaws that dart through slum-filled mega cities, but are not shown on formal maps. Computer app developers and city units use the data to map out networks linking these informal routes with those of traditional buses and trains."The market for smart-city solutions in just heating up," said Kim Fennel, CEO of deCarta, a digital-mapping company now part of Uber. Fennel, along with eBay co-founder Pierre Omidyar, backed the start-up with 1.76-million last year.While commuters in the developed world can easily check the internet to track rail schedules and hail cabs from mobile phones, life isn't as simple for people in emerging countries. Routes taken by informal transport can change without notice and have no set times - if you know where to find them, and can figure out where they're going.In South Africa, city authorities such as Tshwane and the Gautrain transit system in Johannesburg as well as the University of Cape Town, are paying for the data, according to co-founder Devin de Vries.WhereIsMyTransport's staff jump onto passenger vans to track routes or mine global positioning data gathered from mobile phones to build on the platform, said de Vries, who started the venture after winning a Microsoft competition at UCT that sent him to Silicon Valley for a spell.WhereIsMyTransport is far from the first to tackle urban mapping in rapidly changing cities. London-based start-up what3words assigned a three-word code to every 3m x 3m space on the planet for a system adopted by the postal services of Ivory Coast, Mongolia and St Maarten, according to its website. Mapillary, based in Malmo, Sweden, offers users the ability to link landmarks in digital photography with mapping, its website shows.Zippr, created in Hyderabad, India, changes addresses to eight-digit codes overlaid on a Google map to improve accuracy, the firm said.Zippr founder Aditya Vuchi said: "Start-ups need to devise innovative revenue models. Statistically significant data take a while to accrue and can run into privacy hurdles. It requires scale and coverage, hard to create in the early days."WhereIsMyTransport investors include Tom Boardman, former head of Nedbank and chairman of Athena Capital, early stage venture funds Goodwell Investments and Horizen Ventures, and private equity investor Mertech Services, based in Stellenbosch.
