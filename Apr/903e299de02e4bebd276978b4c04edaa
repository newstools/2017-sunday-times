Sundowns, admittedly struggling to keep their expansive squad fit, have now won just two of their last nine matches and will have warning lights flashing. Sibiya, among the finds of the season, sold a clever dummy to turn the Sundowns defence and sprinted away to slot the ball past Kennedy Mweene.It was a massive scalp for Arrows, who have just one major trophy to their name and will now believe they have as good a chance as any of lifting the cup. We were under pressure in the first half but we came strongly through. I m happy for my hardworking players, said victorious coach Clinton Larsen.Sundowns, despite a bevy of injuries and a makeshift-looking line-up, came out of the blocks quickly to immediately put their visitors under pressure and should have been ahead in the eighth minute when Anele Ngcongca s run down the right set up Thapelo Morena, who hit wildly over the top from a tight angle when a pull back would have allowed a teammate an easy tap-in.Khama Billiat s mazy run in the 16th minute ended with Arrows keeper Nkosingiphile Gumede coming out to smother but from the resultant corner Sundowns had another good chance that Ngcongca could not get a decisive touch to, in a goalmouth scramble that Arrows furiously defended.It just before the half hour that the Durban club, coming into the game on the back of two successive wins, got their first chance after a swift sprint on the left by fullback Nkosinathi Mthinyane, who delivered a strong cross that Sibusiso Sibeko was well-positioned to convert but he chose to go with his instep rather than a header and it hit his knee and missed the target.Sibeko also had a chance with the final action of the first half from a corner as he rose unchallenged but headed the ball over the top of the goal.Danny Phiri came on for Sibeko at the start of the second half to beef up the midfield and the game looked more balanced.Sundowns fluffed several half- chances throughout the half but it was Arrows who showed their sharpness with a quickly taken free kick, a through ball to Sibiya and a magical body swerve to take the ball past the Sundowns defence and score.
