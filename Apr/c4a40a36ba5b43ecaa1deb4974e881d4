Her age has been hotly debated since she was found, but in 2015, through technology designed by Darryl Granger at Purdue University in the US, she was pegged at 3.67million years.Lucy, the skeleton of a different species of hominid found in Ethiopia, was previously dated as being much older than Little Foot.At the time of the 2015 finding, Little Foot's discoverer - Professor Ronald Clarke of the University of the Witwatersrand - said Lucy was "often argued to be ancestral to later species that were more in our direct line", so when the 2015 dating placed Little Foot as a contemporary of Lucy, it told us that "there could well have been many species of Australopithecus [an upright-walking hominid with human-like teeth and hands] extending over a much wider area of Africa". Bones of contention divide fossil fundisThis, he said, posed new questions about the diversity, geographic spread and relationships of early hominid species in Africa.The specified date, therefore, could ultimately shed light on which region, and which species, gave rise to humanity.Professor Paul Dirks, one of the lead researchers on the paper that puts Little Foot as being younger than 2.8million years, said: "At 3.7million years, Little Foot would be an alternative candidate species from which we could have evolved, with implications for the exact location of our birthplace in Africa."The age of 3.7million years, however, would also make the fossils of Little Foot at least a million years older than other dated hominin fossils in the Cradle of Humankind, and contradicts earlier age estimates."
