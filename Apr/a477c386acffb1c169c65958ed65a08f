Nhleko, 56, was paid a R30-million salary and a R38.2-million bonus, Africa's biggest mobile phone group said in its annual report published on Thursday. The balance was a fee for simultaneously holding the role of nonexecutive chairman.Nhleko retook the leadership of the Johannesburg-based company on a short-term basis in November 2015 after the resignation of CEO Sifiso Dabengwa."In order to take on this full-time executive role at short notice, Mr Nhleko was required to commit 100% to the MTN task and step away for 16 months from all his considerable other various commercial interests," the wireless operator said."The board negotiated an appropriate monthly fee and performance-related cash bonus contract with him."Nhleko also hired Rob Shuter as new CEOearlier this month. Shuter has been handed a four-year contract, according to the annual report, which did not specify the CEO's salary.Nhleko is now back as nonexecutive chairman and will quit altogether next year.His pay comes on top of R123-million earned from shares sold last year.
