Recent history, especially of the past decade, is replete with stories of him outfoxing opponents, consigning them to oblivion. He also has major flaws, chief among them being a lack of political finesse.Nowhere is this better demonstrated than in his cabinet reshuffle two weeks ago. He made about 20 changes to his executive, but the spotlight has been, rightly so, on the axing of finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas. Before being axed, the two, with former National Treasury director-general Lungisa Fuzile, were recalled from an investor roadshow, which would have seen them and senior Treasury officials, representatives of business and labour spending two days in London, one in Boston and two in New York assuring investors that their billions of investment rands were safe in South Africa.Zuma s recklessness met with a reaction so strong that tens of thousands have taken to the streets calling for him to go. This is understandable, as the two ministers had done a sterling job, under difficult conditions, in rebuilding confidence and the ailing economy.But these were not the only changes in Zuma s executive. Thanks to his clumsiness, no one is talking about the others. While Zuma, as expected, used the reshuffle to dish out patronage, a closer look shows he also used it to inject some much-needed vitality into his cabinet. He brought in Fikile Mbalula as police minister in place of Nathi Nhleko. He handed a long-overdue ministerial position to Ayanda Dlodlo, replacing the inept Faith Muthambi as minister of communications. The two have hit the ground running. Days after being sworn in, Dlodlo instructed the SABC s interim board to commence duties immediately. This week, Mbalula removed Berning Ntlemeza as the head of the Hawks. What a breath of fresh air. It is a pity their appointments have been overshadowed by the president s reckless actions.
