The honorary life president of Premier Soccer League club Bloemfontein Celtic, Molemela pulled himself up by his bootstraps.From humble roots he became a revered business figure, notwithstanding apartheid policies against black business.Born at Sannaspos in 1933, Molemela had no formal education. He taught himself to speak Afrikaans and, as an adult, learnt to read and write.Tales are told of how, as a young man - and fitness fanatic - he rode a bicycle for more than 40km from Sannaspos to Bloemfontein and back.Molemela built an empire that included a construction company whose contracts included the Bloemfontein Magistrate's Court.He became the first black man to own a hotel, the Molemela in Phahameng township. He also owned filling stations.But it was his foray into football that cemented his legend.In 1975 Mangaung United founders Victor Mahatanya and Norman Mathobisa found themselves in monetary difficulty. Molemela breathed life into the club with his financial injection and it was renamed Bloemfontein Celtic.Molemela pioneered professionalism when he became the first club owner to pay players full time.He imported top talent from beyond South Africa. Classy midfielder Ernest Chirwali came in from Malawi as did Cedric Nakhumwa and Stock Dandize. Eden Katango entered from Mozambique. Ronnie Malesetsane was recruited from Lesotho.In some cases, importing players came with controversy as false South African documents were used to register them. The players were deported, but the law did not touch Molemela.He was overjoyed when, in 1985, his team won the Mainstay Cup courtesy of a 2-1 victory over now-defunct African Wanderers.After 26 years at the helm, in 2001 Molemela sold the club to one of his former players, Jimmy Augusti, for R600,000.Molemela's benevolence knew no bounds. There are families who have a roof over their heads because Molemela dug deep to give them dignity.He never allowed his riches to develop a wedge between him and his community, remaining in the township suburb of Rocklands, going against the trend of moving to a leafy suburb.Molemela's affection for the fans, and their adoration of him, was a match made in heaven. He allowed them to attend training sessions and interact with the players at the Molemela Hotel.But he not only stood toe-to-toe with fans who wanted to tell him how to run his club, he clubbed them too - in one infamous incident sorting out a disagreement with rowdy supporters with a knobkerrie.In 2015 the Seisa Ramabodu Stadium in Bloemfontein was renovated and renamed Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium.Yesterday it hosted a memorial service for Molemela, who is survived by five children, 24 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.1933-2017
