Juwi Renewable Energies is one of the companies waiting for round four of the procurement programmes to be finalised so it can start on its 5MW solar photovoltaic project and 138MW wind project. Eskom has given independent providers until April 11 to submit documents confirming they will be ready to start developing projects.Juwi MD Greg Austin said: "Nothing can happen on the ground until financial close is reached and signing off PPAs by Eskom is one of the key project documents comprising financial close," he said.There are 37 outstanding agreements awaiting Eskom's signature.Austin said the delay in signing had been "quite disappointing", and renewable energy companies had been "remarkably patient".Eskom acting CEO Matshela Koko "said he will sign [ power purchase agreements] , so it's great news" , Austin said. But even so he did not think Eskom recognised the R50-billion investment the renewables sector would make and how this would help South Africa .Since July Eskom has refused to sign agreements with independent power producers, saying they cost it a fortune and it considered renewables a pass-through cost that must be recovered in full from the tariff.In February, the National Energy Regulator of South Africa granted Eskom a 2.2% tariff hike, leaving the power utility with R10-billion to recover (although the regulatory framework makes provision for Eskom to appeal) .Minister of Public Enterprises Lynne Brown said last month that the 2.2% increase posed a significant challenge to Eskom's revenue and its ability to meet its debt-repayment obligations.However, Eskom said discussions were continuing with all relevant stakeholders without any commitment date yet.Austin said that if April 11 comes and goes without Eskom signing any deals, the company will not suffer much because it had other private businesses it was working on in South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.For the projects to reach financial close on April 11 requires a budget quote from Eskom, which will enable producers to finalise loans to fund their projects."We've had an e-mail from Eskom saying the budget quote is coming, it's the same scope and it's the same price [as was discussed last year]," Austin said, adding that he believed the deal would be closed soon.Eskom's commitment to signing the agreements comes when the country is experiencing weak electricity demand and surplus electricity.To cover the costs of the deals, Eskom said recently it would shut down five of its power stations whose lives were to be extended. However, Brown said a socioeconomic impact study should be conducted first.Closing Kriel, Grootvlei, Komati, Hendrina and Camden power stations will result in 6000 or more workers losing their jobs - and the National Union of Mineworkers said the job losses would in fact be 40000 because of the impact on other service providers to the power stations, such as transport companies.In a statement this week the NUM called on the government to review the decision to sign the agreements. "As the NUM we are not convinced that implementing IPPs in South Africa is in the best interest of the country and the taxpayer as our research shows renewables have failed in other countries, like Germany," it said.Brenda Martin, chairwoman of the South African Renewable Energy Council, said even if there was a momentary surplus of power, the planning process - which is concerned with long-term power supply security - should not be undermined.She said South Africa was moving towards less carbon-intensive energy sources; moreover, the renewable energy sector globally had proved itself to be successful at job creation."The signing of IPPs is in fact unrelated to the planned closure of coal-fired power stations. Nevertheless, while decommissioning continues as planned, and renewable power is purchased as planned, new jobs will be created along the full value chain of renewable power and related system changes," Martin said.Amid regulatory and legal woes related to the Nersa tariff ruling, Eskom has no choice but to dig into its sovereign guarantees to cover the cost of renewables, meaning taxpayers will foot the bill.Asked whether renewables were not then a detriment to Eskom's balance sheet, Austin said the policy had been adopted and must be followed through. "We have gone into this eyes wide open. We must keep to our policies or explain why we are changing policy, not chop and change."According to the renewable energy council, direct job creation in this sector is around 15000.Frank Campbell, president for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Eaton, a company that provides electrical systems and technology, said renewable energy was an economically viable solution and should have a place in the power portfolio of any entity."You will need more [renewables]. Having electricity is an engine for growth. It's important that the country thinks about that," he said.Given the current surplus and the economic growth potential of the country, South Africa had an opportunity to be a net exporter of electricity to other countries in the region, he said.
