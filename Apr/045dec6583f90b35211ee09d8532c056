Amid discussion of her previous flings with Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty, as well as her marriage to Antonio Banderas, Griffith expressed just one regret: her previous experiences under the surgeon's knife, something she credits to a bad doctor.''I didn't [realise] until people started saying, 'Oh my god, what has she done?' I was so hurt," she recalled. ''I went to a different doctor, and he started dissolving all of this s*** that this other woman doctor had put in. Hopefully, I look more normal now."Movie review: 'Gold' squashes the American Dream with a sad attempt at satirical humour While Griffith was similarly open about her addictions, which have resulted in her being sent to rehab three times, she insisted that her battles with cocaine, alcohol and painkillers did not affect her family life.''I was a totally functioning mom. I wasn't like a drunk-on-the-floor, out-of-it person. I didn't do some things I probably should have done, but, mostly, I was there for my kids. They had a sort of privileged gypsy life."Griffith, part of a Hollywood dynasty that links her mother Tippi Hedren and daughter Dakota Johnson, became a star in the 1980s, with roles in cult romcom Something Wild and the comedy drama Working Girl, which nabbed her an Oscar nomination.Dakota has condemned Hollywood for its ageism. Speaking to Vogue UK in 2016, she said, ''Why isn't my mother in the movies? She's an extraordinary actress. Why isn't my grandmother in the movies? This industry is f****** brutal. No matter how tough you are, sometimes there's the feeling of not being wanted."Despite past career woes, Griffith is currently on the comeback trail. She appears in the James Franco satire The Disaster Artist and has the Al Pacino drama Dabka in the can. - The Daily Telegraph This article was originally published in The Times.
