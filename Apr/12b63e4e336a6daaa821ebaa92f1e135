His latest bout of introspection was brought about by a fractured shoulder suffered against Wales in November last year. The earnest 26-year-old has had time to think. I feel I have grown a lot this last while. More than in any stage in my life. I ve done some soul searching. I m very happy with my personal growth, if I can say that modestly. To grow and to mature off the field. To get my life outside rugby on the right track. To get into a stronger head space. It is always easy when things are going well. By the end of last year Combrinck s stellar Super Rugby season was all but a footnote. He returns to action later this month for the Lions and as much as there is ground to be made up, there are potential insecurities to slay. It would be easy for him to be a lightning rod for gloominess. It is a frustration like it would be for anyone in my position. Especially after I broke my leg [against Argentina] last year. I recovered from that, went on the end of year tour and got injured there. It tests your character. The rough and tumble of professional rugby has taught him to take nothing for granted when he returns. If you re not injured you can certainly take that momentum into a new season. It is like every injury, you start from the bottom. I can t say how this year is going to turn out because I still have to make the Lions team. On that front, teammate Courtnall Skosan is bang in form, while the emergence of Madosh Tambwe has created a stir.The Lions next match is against the Stormers at Newlands next week, but Combrinck is more likely to feature against the Jaguares on the 21st or the Force on the 29th.
