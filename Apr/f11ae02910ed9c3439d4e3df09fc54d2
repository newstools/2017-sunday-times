The news comes as Jos Mourinho dismissed as "absurd" suggestions he is plotting a 173-million move to sign Barcelona and Brazil forward Neymar and stressed that he "always [tries] to be objective and pragmatic" with regard to his transfer demands.Mourinho asked United's hierarchy last year to focus their efforts on signing Griezmann this summer. He thinks highly of AS Monaco's teenage sensation, Kylian Mbapp , even if the 100-million-plus price tag the French club have slapped on the 18-year-old is likely to deter suitors this summer, and Romelu Lukaku's refusal to sign a new contract at Everton has pricked attention at United.But 26-year-old Griezmann remains the top target. He has made repeated favourable references to the Spanish lifestyle in recent weeks and, in turn, talked less fondly about the infamous English weather.But those public utterances have usually been greeted with playful text messages from midfielder Pogba, his close friend and compatriot, that he has nothing to worry about in Manchester, which is renowned for being a rainy city.But complications to sign the Frenchman could arise if Diego Simeone opts to stay on as coach, the Spanish club win the Champions League and United fail to qualify for the competition next season.'Eric Dier going nowhere'MAURICIO Pochettino has sent out a reminder of the faith he and Tottenham Hotspur have placed in Eric Dier as Manchester United circle the England international.United manager Jos Mourinho is prepared to guarantee Dier a role in his midfield if he can persuade Tottenham to sell the 23-year-old star player, who has played most of this season in defence at White Hart Lane.While there is no suggestion that the speculation will unsettle Dier, there is a sense that he prefers to play the holding midfield role.Pochettino dismissed the questions about United's interest in Dier and whether or not the player is happy at Tottenham as "speculation"."Analyse Eric Dier, from where he came," said Pochettino."He came from Portugal, but I think people are a bit confused sometimes. Before, he was in Everton and then he went to Portugal with Sporting, and we signed him as a player with potential."We provided all the tools [for him] to be a Premier League player. My first game in charge against West Ham, he started as a centreback, next to [Youn s] Kaboul. Kyle Naughton got a red card, he moved to fullback and scored."That season, he played like a fullback, like a centreback but never as a midfield player. Then in the summer, we were looking for a midfielder and we had plenty of options [to buy one], but I decided to play Eric in midfield. I created a system that he felt comfortable in."Then we signed [Victor] Wanyama and played both, but we had some injuries and Eric was the perfect player to play as a centreback. That is a good thing for the player, the possibility to play in different positions and do well in every one."Meanwhile, Pochettino has ruled out ever managing Barcelona, despite being spotted with the Catalan club's president Josep Maria Bartomeu last week."I am an Espanyol supporter," Pochettino, an Argentinian, said."It's like if Daniel Levy sacked me in a few years, it would be impossible to manage Arsenal."Leftback Danny Rose is waiting on a specialist to find out when he will return from a knee injury, while star striker Harry Kane has resumed training.
