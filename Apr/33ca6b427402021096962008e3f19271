Q. I am travelling shortly from Cape Town airport to Dubai and from there direct to Dublin in the Republic of Ireland. Will I be subject to the ban on electronic devices and have to put my iPad in my case in the aircraft hold?As you know, the Republic of Ireland is not part of Britain but a sovereign state in its own right and I feel that this does not apply to me but would appreciate your opinion. - Andrew BerryA. Correct. Last month a spokesman for the Irish Department of Transport said that country had no plans to follow suit and had to abide by EU regulations. Security measures at Irish airports have not changed nor are they expected to change in the near future. Do you have a query for our travel expert?
