This motion is the fifth against Zuma since 2014 and the fight is expected to be even more intense. The debate is due to be opened by DA leader Mmusi Maimane, who has used previous motions of no confidence and state of the nation debate speeches to hit out hard at Zuma as part of his election campaign ahead of 2019.Zuma and Maimane verbally sparred when the president appeared in the house to answer questions last month.But Zuma is unlikely to attend the session on April 18, as the rules do not compel him to be present during debates on motions.The EFF, which has repeatedly stated it does not recognise Zuma as president, has previously boycotted similar debates. But for next week s debate it is expected to roll out some of its heavy hitters commander-in-chief Julius Malema and his deputy, Floyd Shivambu.It has also filed for a motion of no confidence in Zuma.The special sitting, for which MPs would be recalled from their Easter break, is likely to be filled with drama, with frivolous points of order from governing party and opposition party benches.EFF MPs often refuse to refer to Zuma either as president or honourable while addressing the house this never sits well with ANC MPs loyal to the president.The ANC, on the other hand, is expected to rely on trusted Zuma defenders who have in the past not disappointed, such as new Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba and Deputy Minister in the Presidency Buti Manamela.Speaking time is divided among all parties represented in parliament according to proportional representation.Once all the speeches have been concluded, votes are electronically cast and the results are immediately available.Each MP s vote is then captured and reflected in parliamentary documents.A simple majority of 200 plus one is required for a motion of no confidence, tabled under section 102 of the constitution, to succeed.The ANC occupies 249 of the 400 seats in the National Assembly, and the rest belong to opposition parties, hence their courting of disgruntled ANC MPs. If successful, the president would have to resign. No motion of no confidence has ever succeeded, as ANC MPs close ranks around Zuma despite unhappiness about his leadership in sections of the party.Should the president be removed, cabinet members would also have to resign. And while the vote to elect the president from among members of the parliament at the first sitting of the house after a general election is done by secret ballot, the rules of parliament do not allow for motions of no confidence to be decided in this fashion.This has not stopped opposition parties from calling for a secret vote following next week s debate on the latest motion of no confidence.However, National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete has said this will not happen. Instead, she said, it was up to MPs to propose a change to the rules of the house on how motions of no confidence should be handled in future.
