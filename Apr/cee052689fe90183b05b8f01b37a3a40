"I think there is a great market opportunity for craft tonics, but they can and often do overpower the gin. Tonic should always be the supporting character," says Lorna Scott from local craft gin brand Inverroche.Lucy Beard, from Cape Town distillery Hope on Hopkins, agrees: "If you're spending so much money on a craft gin, make sure you get the best tonic that goes with it, because some tonics are too flavoured."There is a range of tonics, from commercial to artisanal, but make sure you buy an all-natural tonic that is made with spring water - otherwise your mixer could contain too much sugar and artificial products, which defeats the purpose of buying an artisanal gin. Distilling the essence of South Africa's gin revolutionThe best tonic is the one that works for you. Craft tonic brands available locally include Swaan Tonic, Barker&amp; Quin, Fitch&amp; Leedes, Woodstock Tonic, Fever Tree, Socks Craft Tonic and 031 Tonic Cordial.Not all of these craft tonics are made in South Africa, so check the label if you want a truly homegrown G&amp;T.An experiment by 200 mixologists (on behalf of Miller's gin) found the following:The bartenders overwhelmingly chose ice cubes over crushed ice, but they were more divided on the question of the best tonic, with 33% choosing Schweppes, 23% preferring Seagrams, 22% opting for Canada Dry and 5% going for Perrier.When asked about proportions, 44% of the bartenders said the ideal drink is one-third gin to two-thirds tonic, with 24% opting for a stronger ratio of 40% gin to 60% tonic. And the perfect garnish? The slice of lemon (half a wheel) came out on top with 48%, followed by the lemon wedge (21%).
