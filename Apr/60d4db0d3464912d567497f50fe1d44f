Mathole Motshekga, an MP, NEC member and former ANC chief whip, said the increasing public demands for Zuma to quit were harming South Africa."There is unrest in the country and it is affecting civil and business life, so it is important that the matters that have been placed on the agenda be attended to quickly so that society can return to normalcy and people [can] go on with their work," Motshekga wrote to ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, requesting the meeting.His call for a meeting of the 110-member NEC was made as thousands of protesters from seven opposition parties marched in Pretoria yesterday to demand that Zuma resign.The president's recent shock cabinet reshuffle, which included the sacking of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, has drawn widespread criticism and prompted ratings agencies S&amp;P Global and Fitch to downgrade the country's international credit rating to junk status.A series of marches last week drew tens of thousands in Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town.An ANC national working committee decision on April 4 to defend Zuma should be reviewed, Motshekga said.A vote on a no-confidence motion against Zuma, called by the opposition for next week, was the "greatest exercise in futility" because ANC members would not side with their opponents, he said.The vote, originally scheduled for April 18, was delayed by parliament yesterday after the Constitutional Court said it was willing to consider an application for an order that would force the National Assembly to hold a secret ballot on the no-confidence motion.
