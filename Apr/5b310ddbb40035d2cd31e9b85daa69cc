The premium collection, which is made entirely from sustainable materials - including BIONIC - a polyester made of plastics recycled from shoreline waste - will be launched later this month in approximately 160 stores worldwide (via WWD).In addition to accessories made from recycled waste and a variety of women's garments - including an ethereal statement evening dress of flowing pleats, made from the BIONIC fabric and sported by Natalia Vodianova in the campaign - this year, 2017 H&amp;M 'Conscious Exclusive' collection will also include men's pieces, and for the first time, a selection of styles for kids.Conscious Exclusive is a key part of H&amp;M's move towards a more sustainable future, with 26% of H&amp;M's entire offering now made from sustainable materials. The goal each year is to increase the share, with the company aiming to have 100% of its cotton sustainably sourced by 2020.</img>This dress from the 2017 H&M 'Conscious Exclusive' collection is made from organic silk.
