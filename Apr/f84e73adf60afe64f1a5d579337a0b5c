Net1 also announced plans to appoint more independent directors.Christopher Seabrooke is the new Net1 chairman. Net1 today announced that its Board of directors has determined to split the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles in recognition of the growing practice of U.S. public companies as well as the customary practice of South African public companies to have the Chairman be an independent director Net1 said in a statement. The Board has come to believe that separating the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is the appropriate corporate governance model for the Company at this time especially given its secondary listing on the JSE and its significant South African institutional shareholder base.
