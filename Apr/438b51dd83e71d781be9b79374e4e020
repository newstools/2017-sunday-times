Brian van Niekerk a Klerksdorp resident bought a bakkie from Derick Roodt Motors that he found overheated and had a litany of problems.After the dealership would not help him in the way he had expected he turned to the ASA and complained that the dealership advertised high quality vehicles and excellent-after-sales service neither of which he received.Inspectacar is a company that sells used cars and is a division of Wesbank.According to legal papers filed at the ASA Van Niekerk's bakkie car had many problems.These included:- The headlamp was cracked and had water inside - The mirror covers (which contain the indicators) were both cracked - One of the mirrors did not work electronically - The vehicle was 50 000km behind on its service schedule - The rubbers on the doors were loose - There was a dent in the step-bar on the side and scratches all over the vehicle. - The front bumper was poorly resprayed and polished through - The rear bumper had a dent in it - The number plate light was missing - There was no locking mechanism in the tail flap and - The locking mechanism of the passenger door fell out.When Van Niekerk complained that his bakkie overheated he did not receive his refundable deposit he expected back. The company then fixed it but did not give him a courtesy car to drive while it was being fixed. The dealership also told him it was seeking legal advice on the matter.Inspectacar did not reply to the Advertising Standards Authority in order to give its side of the story so the ASA ruled on the complaint by only hearing the customer's side. The ASA ruling said that: "All reasonable attempts were made to elicit a response from the responsible franchise but no response was received. Correspondence addressed to the contact details on the www.inspectacar.co.za website was also ignored."TMG Digital also discovered that Inspectacar's email address does not work but sends replies saying the address does not exist.The ASA advertising code states that adverts should not have claims that mislead the consumer.The ASA said it could not objectively determine what a "high quality vehicle" was and therefore could not rule on whether the high quality advertising claims were true or false. But it said that it could rule on the claim that the dealer would provide excellent after-sales backup."From the complainant s submissions it would appear that no after-sales service was provided " the ASA found.The Advertising Standards Authority is a voluntary organisation whose rulings only apply to members who agree to abide by the rulings.Inspectacar did not respond to queries about whether it would abide by the ruling.
