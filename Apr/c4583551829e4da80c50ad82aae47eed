Actress Sienna Miller spends "half her time" living with her ex, actor Tom Sturridge, so that their daughter, Marlowe, 4, has stability."Everybody will stay over or we'll all go on holiday, because we genuinely want to be around each other," she said.Actor James Nesbitt's 23-year marriage may have ended last year, but he still "lives around the corner" from his ex-wife, and the erstwhile family spends Christmas together.Even in Hollywood, once a bastion of Babylonian plate-throwing, Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have remained so reluctant to divorce after their split that friends have openly wondered if a reunion is on the cards.The great conscious uncouplers themselves, Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin, were the most visible early adopters of the trend, holidaying together shortly after announcing their split, and still hanging out as a family.Increased awareness of the impact marriage break-ups had on children had led to a new approach, said Sara Davison, author of Uncoupling - How to Survive and Thrive After Breakup and Divorce."Couples with children will often take longer to leave, as there is more at stake for them."They want to make sure they won't have any regrets. The first stage will be separate bedrooms; the second stage will be taking turns to look after the children at weekends, so that even though they live in the same house they will alternate childcare. The final stage is operating separately during the week too."Julian Hawkhead, senior partner at a UK family law firm, said "such arrangements can only be temporary" because however cosy the bird's nest, the impact of a new partner is often going to knock it right out of the tree.
