Q. We are planning on going on a Mediterranean cruise in September. Besides the flight and cruise costs, we have to budget for other things. What would the average cost be in US dollars or euros per person per day for touring the cities at each stop (if booked on the ship itself)?Would it work out cheaper if we took a private taxi (with our own itinerary)? What would be the visa requirements? - Name withheld, this is a surprise for my wife7 reasons to cruise to Mozambique's exotic Ilha islandA. Most lines include all meals and entertainment in the cruise price. Water, juice, tea and coffee are usually included with meals. You will, however, need to budget for alcoholic drinks, if you do drink.Royal Caribbean, a popular cruise line that operates in the Mediterranean, advertises the following prices: beer or a tot of spirits is $7; bottles of wine are on average $32-$60.Cruise companies list their day excursions and prices, so ask about this upfront as it is the easiest option. Book them as soon as you can as some fill up quickly and you don't want to be disappointed.An organised tour will take in more sights, and you won't have the stress of researching what to see or bargaining with a taxi driver. However, taxis do wait at most ports hoping for business, and they could be cheaper for a group of four. Make sure you discuss the full scope of the service before departing and don't pay until the end.You will need a visa for every country you visit, but one Schengen visa will cover most European ports in the Mediterranean. Check this with your travel agent as it really depends on the itinerary.It is also advisable to arrive at the embarkation port a day before departure - in case of flight delays.
