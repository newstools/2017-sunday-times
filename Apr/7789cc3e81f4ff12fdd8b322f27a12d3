Yes it's there, but it doesn't carry any weight."Confidence is the radiant essence of a woman. You could look any kind of way, but you'll always be the most attractive when you feel comfortable in your own skin."My favourite quote says, 'I am in love with my own style, I love my own way of living and I know my own mind'. So be the best version of yourself, accept yourself, love yourself and express yourself."Don't try make yourself into something you're not"I was teased about having very small lips, so for a long time I tried to get makeup artists to' fake' my lips and make them look bigger than they are now I don t do that," says Carver.</img>Musicians Judith Sephuma, Louise Carver and Zoe Modiga at the Bobbi Brown 'Be Who You Are' dinner.
