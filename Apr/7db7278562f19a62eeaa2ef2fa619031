Moeketsi Sekola (fourth minute) and Paulus Masehe (13th) stunned Pirates. Bucs pulled one back through Thela Ngobeni's own goal (25th). Mohammed Anas's free kick (29th) extended the lead again.Tendai Ndoro's injury-time penalty saw Bucs emerge just a goal down from a pulsating first half.Nhlanhla Vilakazi's finely shaped pass from deep left midfield picked out the run of big Stars striker Sekola between leftback Thabo Matlaba and centreback Ayanda Gcaba, who controlled beautifully and smashed past Brighton Mhlongo.From a free kick from a similar position on the left by Sinethemba Jantjie, Masehe got the headed touch for the second.Anas slipped an attempted finish past the upright. Then Anas curled one to skim the crossbar as Pirates' defence was at sea. Bucs reduced the deficit to one when Thembinkosi Lorch's deflected shot was cleared off the line by Rooi Mahamutsa but, unfortunately for Stars, it ricocheted back in off goalkeeper Ngobeni. But Anas smashed in a curled free kick.Bucs again fought back, Oupa Manyisa being brought down by Makhehlene Makhaula, and Ndoro slotting the penalty.After a kamikaze first half, the second was tactical, combusting occasionally.
