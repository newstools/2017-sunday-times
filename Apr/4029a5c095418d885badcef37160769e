Peter Walsh, host of Extreme Clutter, shares a tip that'll take the hard work out of deciding which clothes to keep, and which to donate, on Oprah.com.

By month's end it'll be clear which items you don't wear and so don't warrant precious wardrobe space.In an article on Apartment Therapy, lifestyle editor Taryn Willford shares a piece of advice that'll make sorting through your clothes simple. She recommends you ask yourself, "If I were shopping right now, would I buy this?"
