Of course he is still in the early stages of his highly promising career with lots of improving to do but he seems to have already learned the importance of how to win matches, which is a characteristic of good players.His opening goal, which earned Wits a crucial three points at home and returned them to the top of the Absa Premiership with 41 points after 20 matches, was not a thing of beauty but it was effective enough.Talented players like Mahlambi have a self-destructive tendency of failing to apply basics but last night he gave Wits the lead with the simplest tap-in just before the hour mark.For his goal, Gabadinho Mhango flicked towards stranded Platinum Stars goalkeeper Mbongeni Mzimela, who could only parry the ball on the pass of Mahlambi to apply the finishing touch.Wits' second goal was scored by another crucial member of the team, Daine Klate, who converted from the spot after Thabang Monare was hacked in the box with three minutes on the clock.In the past few weeks, Mahlambi was overloaded with national and club duties leading to some sort of fatigue and it was no surprise when Hunt replaced him in the 65th minute for Sifiso Myeni.Wits also had notable performers on the night like Klate, Thulani Hlatshwayo and Mhango and this victory has given them an advantage over Cape Town City, SuperSport United, Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns in the title chase.For Platinum Stars this loss is a hammer blow as they are stranded in eighth position with 25 points after 21 matches and they will have to get back to winning ways sooner to push for a place in the top eight.The match got off to a lively start with attacking football and Wits striker Mhango was unlucky not to open the scoring during the early exchanges when his close-range shot was deflected to safety by a defender.Stars also had their eye-catching moments when they surged forward with former Bafana Bafana and Orlando Pirates striker Ndumiso Mabena and Bonginkosi Ntuli at the forefront of the attacks.Platinum Stars coach Cavin Johnson started the match with an unusual ploy where he used veteran fullback Vuyo Mere as a holding midfielder but he did not have any significant impact on the game in an unfamiliar position.Like a drunk at a party, Moroka Swallows staggered into the uncertain world of fourth division football having overstayed their welcome and bored everyone witless following relegation to the amateur ranks.A 2-1 defeat by Orange Vaal Professionals in their last match of the Gauteng ABC Motsepe League at Qedilizwe Stadium yesterday delivered the endgame for the Dube Birds, who departed with no flicker of resistance.
