Liverpool's City Council cabinet were expected to confirm its support for the club's plans for a 300-million stadium, a kilometre along the waterfront at Bramley Moore Dock.As with last week's agreement for Everton to acquire this land, there will be cautious optimism rather than cork popping at Goodison Park.The scars of previous blueprints notably at King's Dock, Walton Hall Park and the rather less celebrated aborted move to Kirkby linger enough to ensure the current mantra is focused on delivery above promise.Yet beneath the caution, there is far greater substance to the current mood of aspiration at Everton.Much of it comes from manager Ronald Koeman, an A-list coach who since the New Year has been achieving A-grade results (Everton would be top of the Premier League if only 2017 results counted).Inevitably, it also comes from confidence instilled since billionaire Farhad Moshiri invested in the club just over a year ago.But mostly it comes from a determination to ensure the phrase "knocking on the door of the top six" is made redundant as the foundations that have kept Everton close to the European elite are rewarded.In nine of the last 14 years Everton finished seventh. Three times they were 5th. Once they took a coveted top four place only to (controversially) lose a Champions League qualifier.Building on or maintaining the momentum of encouraging seasons has been challenging, but for chief executive Robert Elstone the years defying the economic trends in the Premier League are the ideal base now the financial picture is healthier."Leicester City aside, more often than not, you do get what you pay for," says Elstone."Having said that, our average finishing position over the past 10 years sits well above our average wage bill and net transfer spend, though, evidently, not well enough to break into the Champions League elite."We said for many years that the clubs above us had either big, modern stadia they filled every week, a billionaire owner or a global fan base built on the back of lengthy periods of on-field success. Add in the recurring, substantial benefit of European football, and the income that generates, and the gap in spending power - wages and transfer fees is substantial."Everton's wage bill is significantly below the six clubs sitting above the club in the League table. In the latest Deloitte Report, Everton's total wages are 70% of Spurs', less than half of Liverpool's and around one-third of Chelsea's."To underscore the optimism in the club, the new investor has arrived and is demonstrating his ambition."Stadium plans have gathered pace and this is significant in that the other clubs in the Premier League either have a new stadium, are building one or arguably don't need to move from their existing stadium. Delivering the stadium would be an important step towards the top four."Also, perhaps an ingredient less tangible, there's a widening belief that it's not just about money. As the club has proven many times in the past, it is possible to outperform budget."The signs are very positive. Young players are pushing for places, results are good and confidence is running high and the manager is at the heart of that. His determination, his burning ambition and his calm and understated approach are very Everton. And, as he would say himself, it is ultimately about actions, not words."When Man City or Chelsea made the step up, they were less constrained by Financial Fair Play rules than we are today. This, along with the overall player wage and transfer inflation, means that the gap is even harder to bridge now, hence we have to be smarter going about it, from our academy operations to player recruitment and building the right infrastructure."Bridging the gap is not just about Premier League points, but also revenue streams. European qualification will open further opportunities."By pretty much all measures total income [dominated for most clubs by broadcast fees], commercial income and wage spend, there's a relatively flat curve from the 20th placed club to the teams playing in Europe," says Elstone."The curve then kicks up, reflecting European football, billionaire owner or big stadium full every week. Commercial revenues are polarising all the time and the big brands and big cheques want the profile of Europe and a new stadium."
