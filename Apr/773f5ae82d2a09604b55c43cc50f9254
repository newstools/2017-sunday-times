Anne Christian, an image consultant at the Image Team, says appearances can even influence the way an employee's performance is measured at work.This might be unfair but, says Jon Foster-Pedley, the dean and director of Henley Business School South Africa: "You can use this to your benefit. Being well groomed earns you respect, improves your interpersonal relationships and may even lead to promotion." How to change careers with no tearsChristian has the following advice: Each company has its own culture, so take this as your lead. If you are still unsure, get some inspiration from what your boss wears, as this will give you an idea of what is acceptable and what is not; Jackets in a neutral colour are a good investment. Always wear a jacket to an interview, a presentation or a meeting with company clients; Make sure your clothes are clean and ironed and your shoes are polished, comfortable and in good condition; Keep your hair clean, neat and well groomed. Men should keep their beards and moustaches trim and tidy; Don't overdo the perfume or aftershave and keep jewellery to a minimum - too many jangling bracelets can irritate your colleagues; Don't show too much skin by wearing revealing outfits like short skirts or low-cut tops - rather keep your more adventurous clothes for after hours; and Dress for the job you want.
