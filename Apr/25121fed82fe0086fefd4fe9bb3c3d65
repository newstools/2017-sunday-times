Michael Payne, widely credited with transforming the International Olympic Committee brand and its finances through sponsorship, said there was no problem with the end product of the Games itself.But the 59-year-old Englishman, a former director of marketing at the IOC who is advising Los Angeles in their 2024 bid, said that was not the case when it comes to convincing the public that they want the Games in their city.The race for the 2024 Summer Games has only two candidates left Los Angeles and Paris after the likes of Boston, Rome and Budapest dropped out due to a perceived lack of popular support.This contrasts with the six candidates the 1992 and 1996 Games attracted and the 2000-2012 editions drew five candidates apiece."To clarify: the bidding process as we know it is dead," Payne said on the sidelines of SportsPro Live in London, a conference on the commercial, political and operational aspects of sport. "The present system that there is a nice beauty contest and then two of them turn up at the altar is dead."Payne, who after leaving the IOC in 2004 performed a similar role with Formula One, said the power of social media had left bidding for the Games open to scrutiny and people wanted to know more than before what public money was being spent on.Budapest abandoned its 2024 bid after young activists collected over a quarter of a million signatures.Fearing spiralling costs and the risk of corruption, the activists said taxpayers should decide how their money is being spent."I think the bidding process for all major events needs radical overhaul and the understanding of hosting them also needs a radical overhaul," Payne said."Everyone has to do a much better job of explaining in the case of the Olympics."It is not that the end product is broken, the audience ratings at the end of Rio [Games in Brazil] were as strong as they have ever been."Los Angeles created the modern Games and buried the memory of the bankrupt city of Montreal and the 1976 Olympics which made nobody want the Games."There is a sense of Groundhog Day... you've been there, done that, now reboot the process."
