The show was set to close on April 9, but has been extended until April 15 due to public demand.So Gauteng readers should hurry down to Craighall Park to pocket an affordable original or limited-edition print by the likes of Zapiro, Derek Bauer, Dov Fedler, Dr Jack and Curtis, Andy Mason, Brandan or Steven Francis and Rico.The array of work stretches way back into the grisly maw of apartheid, and you will flinch and giggle simultaneously at the late great Bauer's visual assaults on PW Botha, FW De Klerk and Mangosuthu Buthelezi. His supremely elegant hatching and Steadmanesque ink splatterings marked out a queasy graphic drumbeat for the 1980s resistance, especially during the State of Emergency. Bauer also exerted an inspirational influence on the world-renowned Zapiro, his successor at the Weekly Mail, who is still punching hard and true these days for the Sunday Times and Daily Maverick.The works by Zapiro are a mix of recent Zuma-bashing classics and old Mandela-lauding favourites, with his superb David Bowie tribute catching the eye on the international front.But the most moving part of the exhibition is a trove of cartoons by Dov Fedler, the beloved veteran of The Star, who recently retired after 50 years of penmanship. If your budget is tight, ask to see a vast selection of small sketches by Fedler, with prices starting at just R100.Richard Chipps's devilish satirical reimaginings of well-known brand logos are flying off the shelf, but there are still plenty of gems up for grabs.Amid a South African "fine art" world that's rife with impenetrable, pretentious and technically bereft bollocks, it's a thrill to see people who can actually draw getting the gallery glory they deserve. Go see this show. You won't be sorry, and you won't be bored.Today at 10am you can join a tour of the show with SA cartooning guru John Curtis, the writing half of the Dr Jack and Curtis team. The exhibition is at Yiull Damaso Artists' Studio &amp; Gallery, 56 Buckingham Ave, Craighall Park, Joburg, until April 15, from 9am through to evenings.
