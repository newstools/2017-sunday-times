Rooney has made 31 appearances for United this season, most of them as a substitute, with manager Jose Mourinho relying more on top goalscorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic before a knee injury ended the 35-year-old's season.Rooney, who played his fourth match in three months in United's 2-0 win over Burnley last Sunday, has also suffered recurring injuries throughout the season.Asked if he could continue playing for another two to three years, Rooney told SkySports, "Yes. Even longer I think. Everyone mentions that age, I'm 31, not an old person." Ronaldo deserves better than this"Who knows, not playing so many games this season might benefit me."Rooney said his experience could help United end the season strongly as they target a Europa League triumph and a top four finish in the league."I feel I can contribute quality, composure, experience, and know-how, how to get over the line, whether it's to win the league or finish top four or get to the final."That's a lot of experience I can contribute to the team," he said. "Of course, it's good to be back ... and hopefully between now and the end of the season and leave a mark."Rooney said he was concentrating on performing to his best until the end of the season amid media reports linking him to a move away from Old Trafford."My focus at the minute is helping us reach the Europa League final, and to win it, and help us get to the top four. That's my focus at the minute," Rooney added."I think I've got a lot to offer, and as I keep saying, I'm looking forward to these next few games, get a few under my belt, and get to where I want to be at the end of the season and see what happens there."Meanwhile, Chris Smalling and Phil Jones still have Manchester United futures, manager Jose Mourinho said this week, despite his reservations about their refusal to play through the pain barrier.Injuries to Smalling, Jones and Marcos Rojo have left Eric Bailly as United's only fit senior centre-back and Mourinho has publicly called on the England pair to put their bodies on the line.
