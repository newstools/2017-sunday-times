Jon Rahm: The 22-year-old won the Farmers Insurance Open this year and rocketed all the way to No14 in the world with an appearance in the finals of the WGC-Dell Match Play last week. He has superstar written all over him.Thomas Pieters: The 25-year-old Ryder Cup stalwart finished T2 at the Genesis Open and T5 at the WGC-Mexico Championship earlier this year. He's a stud, and we know has cojones. He also has a nice pedigree built up playing in college as well as the European Tour (and Ryder Cup) so the moment won't overwhelm him.Tommy Fleetwood: This would not be radically different than Danny Willett winning last year. Fleetwood, 26, is coming off a win at the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship (over Dustin Johnson), and he nearly won the WGC-Mexico Championship over Johnson as well.Alex Nor n: This will be 34-year-old Nor n's 15th major championship as he has always been good enough to play the other three but never qualified for this one. The Swede is playing the greatest golf of his career. He won four times last year including the Scottish Open and European and British Masters.Curtis Luck: The 2016 US Amateur champion played with Jordan Spieth at the Australian Open at the end of last year, and the American was impressed. Spieth called him a "really, really, really impressive player" and said the 20-year-old has "unteachable" stuff in regards to turning bad rounds into good ones. If an amateur is going to win this year, it's going to be Luck.
