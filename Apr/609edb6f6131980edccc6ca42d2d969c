Sharapova, called a "cheat" by Eugenie Bouchard, has yet to drop a point at the Stuttgart Open, for which she received a wildcard entry.When asked about Bouchard's comments, she said: "I'm looking forward."She described her victory as the "best feeling in the world" as the former world No1 returned after testing positive for meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open.Meanwhile, Sharapova says she would "play in the juniors if I have to" to compete at the French Open and Wimbledon, but has no interest in building bridges with her rivals. Sharapova has also been granted wildcards into the Madrid and Rome tournaments, but must wait until May 16 to learn if she will get one for the French. Williams faces ultimate test She was very clear she will take any chance to try to win a third French Open title at Roland Garros, which starts on May 22, or Wimbledon in July."I'd be prepared to play in the juniors if I have to," she replied when asked about her desire to play the French Open or Wimbledon. "I have been offered wildcards and I am accepting them. I am not getting a trophy or golden platter, I have to win the games and that is my job."The organisers' decision to parachute Sharapova into the main draw in Stuttgart, where she has been champion three times, drew criticism from rivals, who believed she was receiving preferential treatment."I can't control what people say, all I can [do] is what I do out there, they are my words and I prefer to walk the walk and I have done it by winning five grand slam titles," she told a packed press conference."Words, quotes and articles are not what matter in life. I have learnt that very well in the last year."I'm coming back. There have been 200 credentials given at this event, and there's news around it, but all that matters is what happens on the court." The Russian says there is no lingering anger about her ban."I am not an individual who gets angry about things, I let things go quickly," she said."I don't spend too much time there [in the locker room], I do my job, which consists of practising and I will go in there, I'll change, get my stuff and I'm out of there," she said.
