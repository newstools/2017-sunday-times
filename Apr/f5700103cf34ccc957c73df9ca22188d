As a mixed-race athlete himself, Hamilton hit back strongly against Nastase's remark that Williams' baby with fianc Alexis Ohanian, the white co-founder of Reddit, would be "chocolate and milk".Williams wrote by way of riposte: "It disappoints me to know we live in a society where people like Ilie Nastase can make such racist comments."Hamilton, who reposted her message on Instagram, said: "I'm very much with her in what she said. I thought it was beautiful. Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari come out on top in Bahrain GP practice"I just think she's awesome. Rather than react in a negative way, reading what she has written just inspires me and, I hope, inspires others."Meanwhile, Nastase apologised at the start of the weekend for his comments and for a foul-mouthed and abusive Fed Cup tirade that saw him suspended by the International Tennis Federation."My words during the Fed Cup have rightfully caused controversy and upset the audience, the press and, most painfully for me, the tennis world," the former world No1 and two-time grand slam winner, 70, said on Facebook.He said that the comments that he made last Friday about the pregnant tennis star - he was overheard by a journalist talking about Williams' baby being "chocolate with milk" - was a "spontaneous" reaction to hearing that she was expecting a child."I am fully aware that nothing can truly excuse my statements - not the tension of a high-stakes game, not my traditionally irreverent attitude, not the unfortunate escalation of the situation," the Romanian said."My life remains dedicated to tennis and its audiences, so please accept my apologies, for whatever they may be worth right now."The day after he made the controversial Williams comments, Nastase was kicked out of a Fed Cup tie between Romania and Britain after swearing at the umpire, at Britain's pregnant captain Anne Keothavong and at their No1 player Johanna Konta.Nastase, who was renowned during his golden era for his pranks, his hot-headed unpredictability and being a playboy, ignored the ban on Sunday and turned up at the venue on the Black Sea coast.He was seen by reporters walking into the VIP lounge.
