Grant says that it will feature parts that Markle ''won't like".Speaking to the Daily Star, Grant said: ''My book deals with my biracial family in a candid, warm, personal and socially important way."But, the working title she gave, The Diary of Princess Pushy's Sister, suggests Markle will feature prominently. Grant, 52, lives in Los Angeles. She suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair.The two sisters share a father, Thomas Markle, an Emmy-winning lighting director. Meghan's mother, Doria Radlan, was Thomas's second wife, and the couple divorced when Meghan was six.After graduating from Northwestern University with a degree in theatre and international relations, Meghan became an actress and is well-known for her regular role on the US series Suits since 2011.Grant and Markle reportedly haven't spoken in almost a decade. Yet Grant has regularly criticised her 35-year-old sibling to the press and on social media."The royal family would be appalled by what she's done to her own family," said Grant. "The truth would kill her relationship with Prince Harry."She's also accused Markle of using charity work to maximise her public image and said Markle had long harboured ambitions of joining the royal family.''She always preferred Harry - she has a soft spot for gingers."Grant's mother Roslyn, from whom Grant is also estranged, has defended Markle against her daughter.''Meghan is very pretty, very nice, very polished and very classy," she said in December. "I never hear anything but good about her from my son Thomas [Jr, Markle's older half-brother]."But Samantha? Samantha has dogged her for the last 20 years. Everything she has said about Meghan is a lie," she said''Maybe when Meghan is more mature and reads the book she'll understand. Some of it she won't like, some she might," said Grant. - The Daily Telegraph This article was originally published in The Times.
