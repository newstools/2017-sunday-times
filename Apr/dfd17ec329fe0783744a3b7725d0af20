Q. My boyfriend and I are not sexually active in the traditional sense, but we do engage in some naked foreplay. Can I get pregnant this way? A. The simple answer is Yes. Pre-ejaculation fluid may contain sperm; the amount of the fluid released can be up to 4ml, which means that a woman can get pregnant even when full ejaculation does not occur within the vagina. Although the actual number of sperm in the pre-ejaculate fluid is lower, the concentration and motility of sperm in pre-ejaculation fluid are equivalent to those of sperm in ejaculate and this is why the chances of pregnancy remain. Withdrawal of the penis from the vagina before ejaculation is unreliable at best and offers no protection from sexually transmitted infections. Ejaculated sperm remain viable for several days within a woman's reproductive tract and fertilisation can occur for as long as the sperm remain alive. This can be up to five days. Men should wear condoms prior to any genital contact to minimise the chance of an unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease. If you require contraceptives, you will need a more reliable and efficacious method of preventing pregnancy. If you're not sure which type of contraceptive is best for you, consult your doctor to understand the options. • Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng (MBChB), sexual and reproductive health practice, DISA Clinic, 011-886-2286, visit safersex.co.za. • Do you have a question about sex?
