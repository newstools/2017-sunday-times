Here are four cool ways to create a graphic eye:Seen at the Desigual F/W 2017 show (pictured above), graphic eyes can work even if you prefer a more minimalist look. Keep the entire lid bare and use an angled brush to sweep a stripe about 3cm long of bold eye paint just under the brow arch. Brush over with an eye shadow in the same colour to set in place. Stay hot this winter with the new season beauty rulesWork jewel-tone liquid eyeliner into the crease of the eye to add an unexpected flash of colour with every blink. Use liquid eyeliner in bold blue, purple or green to keep the look graphic but wearable. Extend the colour a little past the outer corner of the eye to add more impact.Black eyeliner will always be a classic in any makeup bag, but now give it a lightness and new feel without skimping on impact. Play in the waterline and smudge a black gel liner or creamy kohl in with an eyeliner brush.Use a liquid or gel eyeliner with a matte finish when sporting very graphic designs. A matte liner gives a more buildable and punchy end result, so apply until you're comfortable. For real impact, exaggerate the flick of your normal cateye into a graphic triangle that frames the eye.Editor's Tip:Balance out the impact of a graphic eye with well-groomed brows. Spray an eyebrow spoolie with hairspray and lightly brush over the brow hairs to set in place.From top to bottom: CHANEL Stylo Yeux Waterproof in 931 Noir Petrole, R450 Elizabeth Arden Beautiful Color Bold Defining 24H Liquid Eye Liner in Mystic Green, R265 Dolce &amp; Gabbana The Glam Liquid Liner in 01 Black Intense, R620 LA Girl Line Art Matte Eyeliner in 14 Cobalt, R120 YSL Couture Kajal Eye Pencil in 01, R380 Elizabeth Arden Beautiful Color Bold Defining 24H Liquid Eye Liner in Plum Desire, R265
