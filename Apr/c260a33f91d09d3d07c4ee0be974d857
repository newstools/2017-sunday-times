Pep Guardiola's team failed to increase the gap between themselves and Manchester United in Thursday night's derby, but retain a one-point advantage over their rivals and are only a point behind Liverpool with a game in hand.Boro's return to the top flight, however, looks set to be brief. The Teessiders are six points adrift of safety with four matches to play.Guardiola has flattered his players at every turn this season, declaring so many individual performances among the best he has ever seen that you would think Manchester City are the best team in Europe. Chelsea can almost taste the league titleHis praise has been designed to boost morale and build loyalty, of course, but it was interesting - and revealing - to hear him speak bluntly about one of the shortcomings of the squad at his disposal this week.Specifically, Guardiola acknowledged that he simply did not have fullbacks capable of providing the kind of flying attacking impetus he has enjoyed from the likes of Dani Alves and David Alaba at Barcelona and Bayern Munich. His are too old for that, and Jesus Navas is currently his first-choice right-back as a result."[United] can play and have a lot of quality, but they defend so compact and wait to punish you behind your fullback," Guardiola said."We don't have fullbacks to go up and down, up and down, because all of them are 33, 34 years old, so I adapt with the quality of players."The Catalan's supporters argue that he simply has not had the quality he has needed for his demanding style of play this season, and provided City make the right moves, next year will be very different.There is evidence to support that in the way Leroy San , Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus - three young players of superlative ability - briefly combined to dazzling effect under Guardiola's tutelage before Jesus' injury.The circumstances inherited and glimpses of promise shown by this City side will buy Guardiola more time than he had at Barcelona or Bayern, but next season he will find that the pressure is dialed back up. We don't have fullbacks to go up and down, up and down, because all of them are 33, 34 years old, so I adapt with the quality of players For Boro, victory against City could change their fortunes.It has been a difficult return to the Premier League for the northeast club, often unable to score after their defence has put them in strong positions.Hull City's excellent home form could yet be the straw that breaks the camel's back for Boro, as The Tigers become an improving prospect under coach Marco Silva.Boro are the type of team who could give the Sky Blues a shock, but Guardiola knows his men must keep winning if they want to be in the Champions League mix next term.Neither team can afford to lose for different reasons, and City's attacking prowess should allow Guardiola a comfortable night at the Riverside.Boro will have to produce their performance of the season, but City are better suited to playing sides in the top half, due to stylistic reasons.
