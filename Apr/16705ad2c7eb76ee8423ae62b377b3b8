The family, who are at the centre of state capture allegations, came under fire this week for a discourse to be held today and next weekend at the National Museum of Military History near their home in Johannesburg.There have been calls for individuals and organisations to boycott the event, with letters and false cancellations of the event circulating.A civic body, Johannesburg Against Injustice (JAI), said it was calling on Hindu priests, leaders and organisations, and South African and Indian nationals to boycott the event.It said the organisations should rather engage with the Gupta family by writing letters requesting that the family choose the path of righteousness .JAI spokeswoman Peggy Pillay said: At a time when South Africans are making their voices heard loud and clear throughout the country that they will no longer tolerate the lack of accountability, the lack of governance and especially the corruption for the benefit of a few, it cannot be right that the Guptas are allowed to pretend at being God-fearing and humble people. Nari Patel, an ANC member, said he was part of a group asking organisations to take a stand against the Guptas involvement in the discourse. They are almost trying to cleanse their sins in the name of religion and we take offence to that, said Patel.One letter circulating says: Whilst we respect the rights of any family or individual to worship, we believe that perpetual wrongdoers must not use worship to conceal their nefarious deeds, nor as a public relations exercise to turn the tide of public opinion. Prayer designed to conceal corrupt behaviour and to win public support is a futile exercise. The Gupta family did not respond to queries. The museum said the event would take place.In a letter to his members, Pranay Devchand, chairman of the Shree Pretoria Hindu Seva Samaj, said it was up to the members to choose whether they wanted to attend.He said that personally, given the present climate in South Africa, the allegedly corrupt relationship between the Gupta family and Zuma should be denounced.
