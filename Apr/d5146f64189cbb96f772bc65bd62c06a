Law will join Eddie Redmayne who will return to star as Newt Scamander in Fantastic Beasts 2, as well as Johnny Depp, who has been tapped to portray the film's villain Grindelwald.The follow-up film, which is scheduled for release on November 16 2018, is to be set decades before the original Harry Potter films and books, while Dumbledore is still serving as the transfiguration professor at Hogwarts.Commenting on Law's addition to the wizarding cast, director David Yates who is attached again to take the helm said: "Jude Law is a phenomenally talented actor whose work I have long admired, and I'm looking forward to finally having the opportunity to work with him. I know he will brilliantly capture all the unexpected facets of Albus Dumbledore as J.K. Rowling reveals this very different time in his life."
