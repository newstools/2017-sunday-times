In a strongly worded letter to leaders of co-operating parties in parliament, EFF secretary-general Godrich Gardee distanced his party from the movement, saying no agreement was in place for it to be established."No agreement was reached to collaborate in the establishment of an alternative movement called Freedom Movement."The EFF wishes to distance itself from any notion, impression or whatsoever [sic] to associate the EFF with the establishment of the Freedom Movement," Gardee wrote. All political rhetoric needs accountabilityThe EFF took offence after DA leader Mmusi Maimane publicly stated that the EFF supported the movement.This has strengthened the argument of some leaders of the EFF that the DA did not always consult them before publicly claiming the EFF's support.EFF national spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said the tensions between the DA and the EFF should not be exaggerated."We are in opposition to the DA electorally and where they have an overall majority. We are finding common ground with other opposition parties - not just the DA - on specific matters, including removing the ANC from power," said Ndlozi."Regarding the Freedom Movement, we were not given enough time to consult our structures, as is required in the EFF."There is no bad blood between the EFF and the Freedom Movement; we wish them well."The EFF will participate in our numbers in the mass action at the Constitutional Court case on the parliamentary secret ballot and on the day of the motion of no confidence."The EFF is resolute to help save the country from the present kleptocratic government. We will not destabilise these municipalities by handing them back to the ANC kleptocracy."We will negotiate with our fellow opposition parties where problems happen. We are not negotiating with the ANC on anything whatsoever," Ndlozi said.At the same time, the creation of the movement has also revealed new tensions within the DA itself.Two senior leaders of the DA, who asked not be named, this week said that they were uncomfortable that the DA's participation had neither been discussed nor sanctioned by the party's structures before a commitment was made. Minister plans to usher in an era of e-policingMaimane has acknowledged the complexities of the co-operation relationship, but said the arrangement was making a difference."The opposition has never been more united than it is now. It is made up of many organisations, from every ideological perspective, each with differing norms."Co-operation will obviously be complex, and the political terrain changes constantly."As long as we remain focused on our primary objective - saving the future of South Africa by removing the ANC from power - every complexity fades into insignificance and can easily be navigated," said Maimane.Regarding unhappiness in the EFF about lack of consultation, he said the leadership of the EFF had not raised it with him directly, but the matter would be resolved.He said the EFF initially indicated it was supportive of the Freedom Movement march last week, but opposed the idea of a rally."Our relationship remains excellent," said Maimane.
