Sanzaar, made up of the South African, New Zealand, Australian and Argentine unions, met in London last month to straighten out an over-complicated structure.The 18-team format, introduced in 2016 after Argentina s Jaguares and the Sunwolves of Japan joined the competition and South Africa s Kings returned, was widely criticised.SUNWOLVES 21 BULLS 20A try in the 69th minute from Takaaki Nakazuru and a Yu Tamura penalty five minutes later gave the Sunwolves their first win of the year and only their second since their Super Rugby debut last season with a thrilling comeback victory over the three-times champion Bulls.Sunwolves No8 Rahboni Warren-Vosayaco gave the home side the perfect start when he finished off a flowing move in the sixth minute but centre Burger Odendaal shrugged off two tacklers and ran 40 metres to reply for the Bulls.The Sunwolves were 11-10 up at the break but a penalty and a converted try from Bulls winger Travis Ismaiel, who broke three tackles to touch down in the corner, gave the visitors a 20-11 lead in the 63rd minute.After the home side got their noses in front again, replacement back Francois Brummer had a chance to restore the Bulls lead two minutes from time but missed his penalty.HIGHLANDERS 26 BLUES 20Sonny Bill Williams returned to rugby after seven months out injured but could not help the Blues upset the Highlanders in Dunedin.The All Blacks centre, who last played in the 2015 World Cup final, came on as a 55th-minute replacement with the Blues trailing 23-20.A Williams midfield burst almost set up a try, and a muffed pass blew another chance, but the Blues couldn t turn possession into points.Tries from prop Charlie Faumuina and lock Gerard Cowley-Tuioti helped the Blues to a 20-13 halftime lead, but tries from fullback Ben Smith and centre Malakai Fekitoa and 16 points from Marty Banks gave the Highlanders a fourth win.HURRICANES 38 WARATAHS 28The Hurricanes were able to use a scintillating first half to beat the Waratahs, despite having All Blacks flyhalf Beauden Barrett sent off for two yellow cards.
