He was 57.The leather jacket was bought by a Hollywood memorabilia collector who only identified himself as Glenn. Speaking about the sale, Niemi said: "No matter what, it's still a letting go. There's always a little bit of loss associated with that."The auction went ahead despite strong opposition from Swayze's niece. "These were family heirlooms," said Danielle Swayze."It's a slap in the face that she's selling these precious memories."
