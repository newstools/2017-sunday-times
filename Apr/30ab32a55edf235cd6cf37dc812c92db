In a letter to Steenhuisen, Mahlobo's lawyers, BDK Attorneys, accuse him of creating the impression that their client was, among other things, responsible for, or linked to, the break-in and burglary at Mogoeng's offices two weeks ago.The letter refers to a tweet sent by Steenhuisen on March 18: "My money's on Mahlobo and the kak-handed SSA. Signal jammer, imaginary social media villains and inept break-ins. Intimidation of the judiciary." According to Mahlobo's lawyers, any reasonable person reading the comment would understand it as referring to the Mogoeng break-in, which had happened just hours earlier. Following an ANC statement deploring Steenhuisen's tweet, the DA chief whip posted another: "Looks like some nerves were touched. The reaction is rather instructive. Guilty conscience??" Mahlobo's lawyers said this tweet was also defamatory. They said the tweets amounted to Steenhuisen accusing Mahlobo of engaging in unlawful and/or criminal conduct, of engaging in corrupt activities and of attempting to intimidate members of the judiciary.But Steenhuisen told the Sunday Times he was ready to battle Mahlobo in court.The lawyers demanded that Steenhuisen remove both tweets, provide Mahlobo with an undertaking that he would not repeat the allegations and publish a full apology and retraction on Twitter. If he failed to do so, he would face possible legal action.Whoever broke into Mogoeng's offices took 15 computers containing information about judges and judiciary officials.
