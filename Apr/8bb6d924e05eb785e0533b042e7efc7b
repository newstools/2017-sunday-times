A small study among female students found that walking up and down the stairs at a low-intensity pace for 10 minutes was more energising than a midday shot of caffeine equivalent to the amount in a can of soda.Professor Patrick O Connor from the University of Georgia s kinesiology department said there wasn t much change in how the group felt after taking a caffeine or placebo capsule on separate days.Can coffee naps help you power through the day? But with exercise they did feel more energetic and vigorous. It was a temporary feeling felt immediately after the exercise. The research involved 18 chronically sleep-deprived (less than 6.5 hours a night) college women and aimed to simulate an office setting where people don t have much time to exercise.In total the participants walked about 30 floors in 10 minutes at a regular pace. They performed verbal and computer-based tests before and after the exercise to see how well they performed cognitively.Their attention and memory didn t improve significantly but there was a small increase in motivation. Office workers can go outside and walk but weather can be less than ideal. It has never rained on me while walking the stairs said O Connor writing in the Journal of Physiology and Behavior this week. - TMG Digital
