That could explain why Springbok coach Allister Coetzee reportedly sent an SOS to Montpellier hooker Bismarck du Plessis, who last appeared for the Boks against Argentina in the 2015 Rugby World Cup.This paints the remaining South African Super Rugby hookers in a negative light with less than two years before the next showpiece in Japan. Du Plessis turns 33 on May 22, posing a question on his longevity.Former Cheetahs head coach and Springbok hooker Naka Drotsk said Du Plessis still had something to offer but couldn't point out where South Africa's hookers were failing. New rugby boss is aware of the challenges lying ahead"Tight forwards can play until they are about 35 and I still do think Bismarck is well-conditioned. I do think he will be a force in the 2019 World Cup," Drotsk said."We also need to understand that Bismarck is in a class of his own and he has been the best hooker in world rugby for quite some time."With the national team struggling, it will be great to get some experience back. I wouldn't say the youngsters are lacking but there's no one standing out except for a guy like Malcolm Marx."Adriaan Strauss's unexpected international retirement last year threw a spanner into Coetzee's works but he still commands a starting place at the Bulls.The feisty Edgar Marutlulle and the reliable Jaco Visagie have to swap on the bench in Pretoria while the Sharks' Franco Marais and Mahlatse "Chiliboy" Ralepelle have been serviceable at best. The Lions' Marx has fed off the energy of his dominant pack while not being outstanding.The Stormers' Bongi Mbonambi may have added value to the team's loose play but hasn't been the best in his primary role as a lineout thrower. With the lineout being the most important aspect of the Springboks' attacking play, hookers cannot fail in their primary function.While Drotsk didn't want to extol on the various players' weaknesses, he nominated Marx as the heir to Du Plessis's throne.
