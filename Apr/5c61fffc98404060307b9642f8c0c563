Steve Biko, who died at the hands of the apartheid security apparatus 40 years ago in September, did not admire white liberals.Although it can be said, in that very South African way, that some of Biko's best friends (notably Donald Woods) were white liberals, he was deeply critical of their role in black liberation.In the August 1970 edition of his column "I Write What I Like", this icon of black consciousness wrote thus:"The role of the white liberal in the black man's history in South Africa is a curious one. Very few black organisations were not under white direction. True to their image, the white liberals always knew what was good for the blacks, and told them so."The wonder of it all is that the black people believed them for so long. It was only by the end of the 1950s that the blacks started demanding to be their own guardians."Nowhere is the arrogance of the liberal ideology illustrated so well as in their insistence that the problems of the country can only be solved by a bilateral approach involving both black and white."This has, by and large, come to be taken in all seriousness as the modus operandi in South Africa by all those who claim they would like a change in the status quo."Hence the multiracial political organisations and parties and the 'nonracial' student organisations, all of which insist on integration not only as an end goal but also as a means."The integration that they talk about is first of all artificial in that it is a response to conscious manoeuvre rather than to the dictates of the inner soul. In other words, the people forming the integrated complex have been extracted from various segregated societies with their inbuilt complexes of superiority and inferiority and these continue to manifest themselves even in the 'nonracial' set-up of the integrated complex."As a result, the integration so achieved is a one-way course, with the whites doing all the talking and the blacks the listening."Biko's words of 47 years ago chime with the debate on the positives and negatives of colonisation unleashed on South Africa these past two weeks.The debate showed to all who did not know that the new South Africa is indeed still populated and challenged by old South Africans - that old habits and ingrained prejudices die hard.Outside the integrated intellectual elite, there was a depressing familiarity and predictability about the debate so thoughtlessly and irresponsibly - yet so revealingly - unleashed.Black South Africans of all hues were generally and genuinely deeply offended at the callousness of the statement that colonialism was not all bad.Whites - especially English-speaking ones - were quick to defend the statement.Although it must be said that there were many exceptions in that many whites - including progressive DA MPs - distanced themselves from the belief that colonialism was not all bad, a hefty majority of those whites who made their views public were of the opinion that colonialism was, on balance, a beneficent system to the country. As was clear from the hurt and self-righteous tone of many who listed colonialism's benefits, many whites still identify with colonialism to the extent that they feel affronted when it is criticised and personally alienated when its negative effects are accentuated.The affront to these whites - many, maybe most, of whom would class themselves "liberals" in favour of black progress - proves Biko right.Inherently, such defenders of colonialism see the colonialist legacy of which they are the embodiment as, on balance, a positive progression on the pre-colonial African state; although of course for the most part not uncritically so, to be fair.But ingrained in that belief - which, brutally stripped of pretence and niceties, could be somewhat unfairly worded as that black people are welcome to lead as long as they take the lessons of a generally benevolent Western civilisation as their lodestar - are what Biko terms the "inbuilt complexes of superiority and inferiority" which inform the integrated complex.So stripped to the core, the black liberation critique of a form of white liberalism much in evidence these past two weeks is that it believes white culture to be superior to black culture, and the informing of black culture by white cultural norms to represent progress.Against this, black liberation balks, for what use is liberation if it means imitation?So, in the current debate, white liberals stand accused once more of being do-gooders driven by superiority complexes, causing anger on both sides of a racial divide most South Africans are trying hard to bridge.And yet a certain type of self-proclaimed white liberal seems oblivious to the effect - angry at the response it elicits.Now of course, as Humpty Dumpty so memorably said in Lewis Carroll's masterpiece, Alice in Wonderland: "When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less."That is true of liberalism, of liberals and maybe of any other label. Maybe one should not be too illiberal in defining liberalism or, as Michael Cardo said when launching his excellent book, Opening Men's Eyes, we should be careful about appropriating liberalism.But is there a different way of viewing and being South African liberals to what Biko believed and what is currently so brutally evidenced?Surely, yes, and that is the Alan Paton definition of a specifically South African ideal of liberalism.In a lecture delivered in 1953, he stated: "By liberalism I don't mean the creed of any party or any century."I mean a generosity of spirit, a tolerance of others, an attempt to comprehend otherness, a commitment to the rule of law, a high ideal of the worth and dignity of man, a repugnance of authoritarianism and a love of freedom."That is the credo to which many of us who also view ourselves as liberal subscribe.It is a kinder, gentler, different way of viewing life - it asks of us to comprehend and learn, not to defend and lecture.At its very core, Paton's definition, in each of its parts, goes against everything colonialism is and was, for even that which on the face of it represents colonial progress was done in the interest of the greater goal of colonial extraction - nothing colonialism did went against the basic goal of serving the interests of the colonial master country.So, despite Biko's opinion and current manifestations, surely colonialism is a system no one deeply committed to liberalism - at least of the Patonian kind - can do anything but oppose.Or perhaps one should conclude by sharing the rather exasperated view of the English writer and philosopher GK Chesterton: "As much as I ever did, more than I ever did, I believe in liberalism. But there was a rosy time of innocence when I believed in liberals."
