South African patriotism burnt brightly in Europe recently when an expat offered up her scarf to the team for opening ceremony of the Special Olympics World Winter Games in Graz, Austria. Bronwen Sarson, 35, was astonished when, a few minutes later, she discovered that the princess was to wear the scarf, in the colours of the national flag, when she walked with Team South Africa two weeks ago.Sarson, originally from KwaZulu-Natal although she now lives in Austria, said she had no idea a princess would be wearing her scarf."I felt extremely proud, like I had done a service for my country in a small way. I have lived away from South Africa for 13 years, but I still consider it home," said Sarson, who didn't get to meet the princess.She said she was asked by Special Olympics South Africa CEO Ancilla Smith if she would give up her scarf."She said a special guest would be walking with Team South Africa ... and needed something in the South African colours to wear. I was honoured and said yes without hesitation." A few minutes later she learnt who the special guest was. "It is exciting that Princess Charlene wore my scarf, but I would have been as happy to help any fellow South African," said Sarson."I kept it to wear to rugby matches, but it was destined for greater things. I told Ancilla that I didn't need my scarf back, but I have an exciting story to remember it by."Smith said the team learnt, on the eve of their departure for the games, that Princess Charlene would join them in the athletes' parade."We really wanted to provide the princess with something that she could wear," she said. But they could find nothing appropriate - either in their belongings or in Graz."Bronwen had been in touch with us before the games wanting to support Team South Africa." The expat, her two daughters and a friend arrived, as arranged, to watch a hockey match - and it was then Smith spotted and asked for the scarf.
