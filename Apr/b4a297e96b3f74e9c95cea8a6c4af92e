She was gunned down two weeks ago at Laduma High School, where she was the deputy principal and acting principal.It was a Saturday morning and Mchunu, as was her wont, was sitting on a desk in front of her Grade 12 history class. She frequently gave up her Saturday mornings to give her matrics extra lessons.According to the deputy chairman of the school's governing body, Thulani Dlamini, two armed men approached the class. A third waited in a car. One stood by the door and kept his eyes on the pupils while his accomplice walked up to Mchunu and started shooting.They walked out. Then the one who had fired the shots came back into the classroom and fired three more shots at her head.It had the hallmarks of a hit, and happened a couple of years after a jobs-for-cash racket - whereby senior teaching posts were sold, often after incumbents had been warned to vacate their posts or be killed - was exposed.Mchunu was born in Nkandla on March 24 1962. She graduated with a bachelor of education degree from the University of Zululand.She had been teaching at Laduma High School in Mpumuza, 25km from Pietermaritzburg, for 26 years. She joined the school as head of the humanities department in 1991.She was appointed deputy principal last year, and became acting principal when the incumbent retired in January this year.She loved teaching and took it very seriously.
