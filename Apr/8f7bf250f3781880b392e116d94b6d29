South Africa is trapped between what could be described as an intractable present and irrecoverable past - between things that are no longer and things that are not yet.The cabinet reshuffle by the president has created anxiety and some confusion in certain sectors of society.The reaction by different groups may also be fuelled by inconsistent messages emanating from the ANC's national officials. Following politics of self-destruction Paragraph 40 of the ANC document titled "Through the Eye of the Needle" says: "An individual with qualities of leadership does not seek to gain popularity by undermining those in positions of responsibility. Where such a member has a view on how to improve things or correct mistakes, she should state those views in constitutional structures and seek to win others to her own thinking. She should assist the movement as a whole to improve its work, and not stand aside to claim perfection out of inactivity."Anything other than what this seminal document of our movement says constitutes a grave betrayal of the revolutionary tradition the current generation inherited from president Oliver Tambo and his generation.The conduct of current national officials and former leaders of our movement must always be judged and assessed on the basis of what this important document demands of those in leadership positions.In a democratic state, people have a right to disagree with decisions taken by the head of state.However, the leadership of the national democratic revolution must always handle every development in a manner that reinforces the confidence of the masses of our people, rather than for self-promotion.Acting in the best interests of the ANC and masses of our people, the national working committee convened a special meeting to rein in conduct that was inconsistent with the traditions of the ANC.Some of the issues dominating public discourse since the cabinet reshuffle include an alleged failure by the president to consult regarding the reshuffle.This has been clarified by the committee: the president engaged with national officials way back in November last year, citing an irretrievable breakdown of trust between himself and former finance minister Pravin Gordhan.It is imperative to reiterate that the president has the powers to appoint members of cabinet. The impact of the conduct displayed by some of the ANC national officials is yet to be fully felt by the movement as whole It is now acknowledged that the primary reason to release Gordhan was the irretrievable breakdown of the relationship between him and the president, and that the president acted within the parameters of the constitution.Riding on the wrong notion relating to some "failure to consult" that created a dangerous impression that the president acted on the basis of some directive from some business people, the opponents of the ANC mobilised society against the ANC.The impact of the conduct displayed by some of the ANC national officials is yet to be fully felt by the movement as whole.But the ANC is older than problems and will, once again, triumph over this difficult period.It is true the ANC's 52nd National Conference resolution states that "the prerogative of the president, premiers and mayors to appoint and release members of the cabinet, executive council and mayoral committees should be exercised after consultation with the leadership of the organisation".In some instances this process of consultation is misconstrued as if it meant "reaching consensus".In a big, diverse and complex organisation like the ANC, comrades have different views and aspirations. However, once a decision has been taken it is in the interest of all members to support that decision as part of a collective.It is important to emphasise that all deployees of the ANC appreciate the fact that they serve at the behest of the ANC.The ANC remains the key strategic centre of power which must exercise leadership in pursuit of the objectives of the national democratic revolution. Blood on the floor, but not a peep from the ANC's 'good guys' The comrades newly appointed to cabinet have the necessary capacity and skills to manage their portfolios diligently.On fiscal policy we are satisfied that new Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba has reaffirmed the ANC's position that the "National Treasury will work within the fiscal framework as agreed by government and parliament and that there will not be any reckless decisions on spending".This statement elucidates the known principle that the ANC is driven by policies, not individuals, and that deployed comrades must implement ANC policies.Let us turn to the malicious attempt by opposition parties to co-opt ANC MPs to be in cahoots with their self-serving ends of removing the ANC from power.The opposition is proposing members of the ANC abandon their dearly beloved movement, and, strangely, they are claiming this will in turn make the ANC stronger and somehow renew it.The two propositions are irrational and illogical.It was the ANC that campaigned during the 2014 elections on the basis of its manifesto, and on that basis South Africans voted for the ANC to lead them.In turn the ANC submitted a list of its most trusted cadres to be in parliament and represent the ANC in the execution of the very same manifesto.ANC MPs must reject the twisted and convoluted plan to paint them as a group of individuals, loosely collected from the general populace, without a political home and willing to participate in the demise of their own movement.Certainly, this bears all the hallmarks of counter-revolutionary tendencies.
