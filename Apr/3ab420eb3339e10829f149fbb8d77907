Thandeka Lujiza, chief director in the office of the secretary of defence, was suspended in May 2014 on seven charges of misconduct. She has since been fighting for reinstatement.To make matters worse, after the Department of Defence dragged its feet in holding a disciplinary hearing, it was found that Lujiza had done nothing wrong. The internal probe, in November, cleared her of wrongdoing, but the department refuses to reinstate her.In a letter dated May 31 2016 to Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, before the disciplinary process started, Lujiza said that, on May 5 2014, she was told of her suspension and military police escorted her to her car "like a common criminal".She wrote: "Military police were sent to my house twice, without me or my attorneys being [notified] thereof, to deliver the charge sheet, which is so poorly drafted it is embarrassing even reading it."Lujiza, who earns R1.1-million a year, said legal costs had put her under financial strain.In documents seen by the Sunday Times, the seven charges presented to the disciplinary hearing by Maete Lengolo, a senior official at the department, included that Lujiza: Challenged the senior appointments made by the secretary of defence, whom she reported to, and was disrespectful towards Lengolo; Refused to give the keys to the office of the secretary of defence to Lengolo when she first reported to the office; Terminated cellphone contracts, saying that they were "unauthorised"; Rejected travel requisitions without reason; and "Never" came early to work.But in November, Lujiza was cleared by the disciplinary committee's presiding officer, Advocate Simon Molatlhwe Shaba. But Shaba found that the working relationship between Lujiza and many senior officials had broken down completely."Although parties have adduced evidence for and against the irretrievable breakdown of the employment relationship of trust between the [secretary of defence] and Ms Lujiza, at this stage of the proceedings and in this hearing such subject matter is irrelevant and misplaced," he said in a document dated November 4.A letter of demand sent to the secretary of defence by her lawyers in January instructs the department that Lujiza would report for duty on January 16 2017 to execute her duties.The department, however, ordered her not to return to work.In response, the defence force's acting chief of human resources, Ntsiki Memela-Motumi, referred to a clause in the disciplinary committee's report stating that both parties could still seek legal advice.Asked about her fight with the Department of Defence, Lujiza referred questions to her lawyers. Her lawyer, Graham Moshoana, said the department's argument was flawed because it indicated that it had extended Lujiza's suspension pending a legal opinion."We now might be approaching the courts to seek reprieve. They suspended her and even took about a year to issue her with charges. It is total waste of taxpayers' money to pay someone without [them] even lifting a finger," he said.Defence spokesman Siphiwe Dlamini said Lujiza was placed on special leave following the presiding officer's finding of a "total breakdown of trust"."Both parties must seek legal advice on how to deal with the incompatibility. That process has now been finalised and the affected parties will be engaging and the person concerned is fully aware of that process."
