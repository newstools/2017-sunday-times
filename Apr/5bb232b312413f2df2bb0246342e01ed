The request follows Anglo s announcement earlier this month that it is selling its three Eskom-tied domestic thermal coal operations as well as four closed collieries to Seriti for R2.3bn.Anglo said the sale which was expected to close before the end of this year was subject to conditions such as regulatory approvals.Exposure to Eskom hits ExxaroThe centre wants Anglo to make key environmental documentation on the mines publicly available.The reason for the request was the growing trend in South Africa where large mining companies often with major environmental liabilities sell their mines to smaller mining companies the centre said.It said these smaller companies were often either unwilling or unable to fulfil the rehabilitation obligations imposed by the mining rights for these operationsWhen environmental liabilities are abandoned they become the responsibility of the state and therefore the responsibility of South African taxpayers.By 2015 the cost of closure of SA s abandoned mines was estimated at almost R60 billion the centre said.The centre said the lack of transparency with which these transfers were implemented severely worsened this problem.Seriti set to become key player in coalFollowing the announcement of the sale the centre s executive director Melissa Fourie addressed a letter to Anglo CEO Mark Cutifani to ask for the sale to be transparent. Conducting the sale transparently and making key environmental and social documentation publicly available will improve the prospects of the sale of these assets proceeding in such a manner that the environmental liabilities are not ultimately abandoned becoming the responsibility of the state and therefore the South African public Fourie said.Anglo American on Wednesday acknowledged receipt of the letter.Anglo said it was in the process of responding directly to the CER on issues raised in the letter. Anglo American remains committed to complying with all applicable laws including those that relate to the publication of records to which the CER is wishing to have access Anglo spokeswoman Ann Farndell said.Farndell said Anglo would publish all information that it was required to publish in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed timeframes.
