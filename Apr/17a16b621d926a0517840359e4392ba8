Mamparalula shocked us all this week with a reckless statement to the effect that disgruntled Zimbabwean soldiers were fuelling crime in South Africa. Mbaweezy didn't even attempt to present evidence to back remarks that bordered on xenophobia.It's this sort of ignorance that provoked violent scenes in this country not too long ago.A senior cabinet minister should know better.
