This breaks down the wall of Eurocentric content by using local characters to tell tales from African history.Squeers, a web series in development also by Zeropoint Studio. This series takes a satirical but affectionate look at the daily escapades of two gay squirrels, Neil and Artel, in their search for success, love and happiness.Musi and Cuckoo from Bugbox animation, which has benefited from a residency in France since last year's Annecy festival. Set in Tubatuba Town, home to a "rainbow nation" of animal friends, this tells the story of Musi, a jolly hippo, and Cuckoo, a whacky chicken, who help everyone in their community, by working together.Waterloo and Trafalgar by Matthew Torode, who is currently working in collaboration with a French director. Based on the children's book by the same name, it looks at the absurdity of war by revealing a broader and more peaceful context.Kariba by Daniel Clarke, who has launched a Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign to finance his project. It is a fantasy-adventure graphic novel inspired by the mythology and history surrounding the construction of one of the largest dams ever built in southern Africa.
