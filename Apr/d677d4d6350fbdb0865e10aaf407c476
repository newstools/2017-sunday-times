Maboke Matlakala scored the 56th-minute winner for desperate, last-placed Baroka at Mbombela Stadium.SuperSport had a chance of beating a PSL record their coach, Stuart Baxter, set when he steered Chiefs to in 2014-15.Yesterday's performance by Matsantsantsa displayed why their same length of unbeaten runs seems unlikely to yield the championship.SuperSport have at times stumbled unconvincingly to their unbeaten results, and the nine draws among them are testimony to that.Baroka deserve credit for how they took the game to SuperSport, who, in turn, were sloppy with their chances.SuperSport dominated possession in the first half, though found chances hard to come by.Kingston Nkhatha got on the end of Thabo Mnyamane's long-ball from deep inside the SuperSport half early in the second half, but Oscarine Masuluke spread himself well.A miscued clearance by Morgan Gould saw Onismor Bhasera under pressure with a poorly directed header, allowing Matlakala to beat Pieterse with a chip.
