Dangor's home in Johannesburg was broken into two weeks ago and he has allegedly received threatening phone calls and messages saying he was obstructionist and would have to be "removed".According to a source close to the family, a private security firm has been hired to protect the home around the clock. This includes several guards and surveillance."The investigators are concerned Dangor's life is in danger and they have told him this," said the source. 'Blame Sassa,' Bathabile Dlamini tells highest courtDangor said he would not comment on the issue for the "sake of my family's safety".Two weeks ago two men, who arrived in separate cars, brazenly walked into his home while he was not there and told an employee they had been sent by him to fix something. After some resistance, his adult son, his daughter, his granddaughter and the employee locked themselves in a bedroom.The men rummaged through the house and physically assaulted his son during a scuffle, but did not take anything.According to police officers close to the case there have been subsequent threats to the Dangor family, prompting them to increase security.After 10 years at the department, Dangor resigned last month in the midst of the social grants scandal, saying he was leaving due to a communication breakdown with minister Bathabile Dlamini. But those close to him believe the break-in and threats are linked to his work and what he knows about the Cash Paymaster Services deal with the state."The break-in was not normal," said a police officer close to the case.Last month the Sunday Times reported that Dlamini summoned Dangor and South African Social Security Agency officials to a meeting in December at a hotel where President Jacob Zuma's legal adviser, Michael Hulley, was present.During that meeting Dangor and Hulley allegedly exchanged heated words about the legal route Sassa should take regarding the CPS contract to distribute grants.Sources said Dangor opposed both Hulley's involvement and the extension of the CPS contract. He refused to attend a follow-up meeting with Hulley at his Durban office, requested by the minister.It is understood Dangor was at the forefront of setting up a task team comprising officials from the Department of Social Development, the Treasury, the Reserve Bank and Sassa to find a way of paying grants without the involvement of CPS - something that angered Dlamini.
