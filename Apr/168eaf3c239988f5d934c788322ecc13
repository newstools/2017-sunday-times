Designer Jacques van der Watt revealed his first entirely gender-neutral collection under his label, Black Coffee, last night.While gender neutrality is a huge trend across the globe - Time magazine had a cover story on it last week - only a few brave designers have tackled it head-on, sourcing models ascomfortable on a male runway as they are on a female one.Van der Watt chose to show his collection under the menswear banner of South African Fashion Week.Style commentator Jackie Burger said: "In the past year the trend of gender neutrality has developed. Designers have embraced gender fluidity in collections, mimicking the shift in fashion which calls for style without boundaries, codes or structures.

"The starting point was the number 5," he said. "If you consider the number, you realise it's the perfect embodiment of masculine and feminine - the hard lines at the top of the digit, combined with the bulging curves at the bottom."The Black Coffee collection embodies these notions - straight, athletic shorts, but in feminine fabrics such as mesh with ribbons as draw strings."Men are eager to wear great clothes, but until now the fashion industry has been aimed at women ... Men have far less scope for expression."Van der Watt said he had always created clothes that appealed to men and women, but until now he hadn't consciously made a move towards making clothes that could be worn by both sexes."Regardless of the global trends, it's a clever business move," he said. "It doubles the number of clients [to whom] we've sold our range."Also a hit at South African Fashion Week was Woolworths' Style by SA capsule collection. In it, eight young designers showcased local youth culture, with a male model in a hoodie paired with thigh-high stiletto boots and another in a feminine jumpsuit with skyscraper heels.Designer Rich Mnisi said: "I believe in a gender-free approach. People are being shown that gender expression isn't rigid and binary, it is a spectrum that every human being has the right to explore."
