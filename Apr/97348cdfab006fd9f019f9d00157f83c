Delivering his Easter sermon at St George s Cathedral in Cape Town last night, Makgoba said the opportunity lay in convening a land Codesa to negotiate a solution to this emotional issue and, in light of the downgrades of our credit ratings, an economic Codesa too .The Convention for a Democratic South Africa was convened in 1991 to negotiate the transition from apartheid to democracy.Makgoba said in his sermon: Personal interests, corruption, private gain, entitlement, a vicious contempt for the poor and the common good, a culture of blatant lies and cronyism and possibly worse dominate our public landscape. Some among our leaders have become slaves to a new form of colonial oppression. But he added: At the heart of the message of the resurrection of Jesus is the stubborn insistence that nothing is irrevocable. No betrayal is final. There is no loss that cannot be redeemed. It is never too late to start again. Let the different interest groups and elements of our society ... find one another in a powerful, united coalition which puts first the interests of the poor and thereby ... of all of us.
