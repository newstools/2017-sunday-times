The Australian tennis legend has been criticised by a number of prominent tennis personalities including Andy Murray for a series of homophobic comments.Speaking on Vision Christian Radio, Court blamed lesbian tennis players for leading younger colleagues astray, and said transgender people are influenced by the devil.Court said: "Tennis is full of lesbians. Even when I was playing there were only a couple there but [they] led young ones into parties. And what you get at the top is often what you'll get right through that sport."After Court said she would boycott Australian airline Quantas over their support of gay marriage, Martina Navratilova, who is married to her partner Julia Lemigova, wrote an open letter for the Australian Open stadium to be renamed."I think the Evonne Goolagong Arena has a great ring to it," Navratilova wrote."Now there is a person we can all celebrate. On every level."A mysterious computer whizz made Navratilova's suggestion reality by editing the name of the Australian Open's second-biggest arena so that it appeared as "the Evonne Goolagong Arena" on Google Maps.Google fixed the edit on Wednesday afternoon and explained the change was not initiated by the company."Our wide range of sources, including third-party providers, public sources, and user contributions" helped make their maps all-encompassing, but there is a trade-off."We recognise that there may be occasional inaccuracies that could arise from any of those sources," the spokesman said.A petition for the stadium to be officially renamed after Evonne Goolagong has received almost 10,000 signatures online.
