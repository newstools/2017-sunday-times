This was to ferry various invited military and civilian dignitaries to the South African Army Combat Training Centre in Lohatla Northern Cape."These dignitaries and captains of the defence industry were invited to attend the 2015 edition of 'Exercise Amani Africa' a force preparation exercise with various regional militaries."He said the SANDF made use of chartered aircraft when available serviceable aircraft were certified to be inadequate to safely ferry a specific number of passengers and or goods "or when the serviceability status is assessed to have a potential to compromise the safety of both passengers and or crew ."It is standard aircraft charter procedure for the Department to forward a request for an aircraft charter through the National Treasury approved contract processes."It is through this process that ExecuJet was appointed as the service provider for the required aircraft. The SANDF has no influence nor say in how the charter process is managed and the required aircraft is solicited."-TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
