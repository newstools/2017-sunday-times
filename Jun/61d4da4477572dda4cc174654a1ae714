The research, conducted among Chinese adults, discovered that a moderate daily alcohol intake (most visible with beer) helps slow the decline of high-density lipoprotein, or "good" cholesterol, better than not drinking at all. There are more surprising health perks in your beer glass than you may think (though you should always drink in moderation): Beer lowers the risk of kidney stones Last year a study suggested that the risk of developing kidney stones decreases with increasing beer consumption. Researchers for the National Public Health Institute of Helsinki, Finland, used their study of 27000 middle-aged men to conclude that "each bottle of beer consumed per day reduced risk by 40%". The researchers noted that both the water and alcohol found in beer are shown to increase urine flow and dilute urine, thereby reducing the risk of stones forming. Beer protects you from heart attacks University of Scranton, US, researchers found that dark ales and stouts can reduce the incidence of heart attacks. Beer reduces risk of strokes Studies by Harvard Medical School and the US Stroke Association showed that people who drink moderate amounts of beer can cut their risk of strokes by up to 50%, compared with non-drinkers. Ischaemic strokes, the most common type of stroke, occur when a blood clot blocks the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain. But, when you drink beer, your arteries become flexible and blood flow improves significantly. Beer strengthens your bones Beer contains high levels of silicon which promotes bone growth. Academics at Tufts University, US, found that while one or two glasses of beer a day could reduce your risk of fracturing bones, more than that would actually raise the risk. Beer decreases diabetes risk In 2011 Michel Joosten of the Harvard School of Public Health studied 38000 middle-aged men and concluded that the alcohol content in beer increases insulin sensitivity, which helps prevent diabetes.
