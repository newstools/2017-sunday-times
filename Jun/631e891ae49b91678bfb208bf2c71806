His exhibition, Lefa La Ntate, is on at the Standard Bank Gallery in Johannesburg.We find out more.Where did your love for art begin?When I realised I had an ability that other people could recognise. That was in primary school.How did you decide to become an artist?I've always known I wanted to be an artist but decided on a career in art in 2004, my matric year, when I was exposed to art on a trip to London. The next year I decided to enrol myself in the Fine Arts pro-gramme at the University of Cape Town.What surprised you about your career when you began?After spending four years at the Michaelis School of Fine Art, I was shocked that in the art world itself - outside the insulated environment of the school - there was a lack of black artists in a predominantly black country.Your typical day?I spend most days communicating with institutions, curators and collectors who might be interested in my work - I'm constantly trying to figure out my next project. The rest of my time is spent between the studio and home, and sometimes on the road depending on what sort of project I'm working on.What's surprising about your work?People might find it interesting that my work is often a result of a process of research and immersing myself in my chosen subject matter and theme, but also submitting myself to the work so that the process of making becomes more intuitive - sort of ''conjuring".What do you love most about your work?That it takes an archaeological approach to engaging the many layers of history.Most challenging about your work?I use my own image in my work so people tend to relate more to the image and not so much the work. When I meet people for the first time they approach me with a sense of familiarity, which is a bit strange.Most memorable highlight?Participating in the South African Pavilion [at the Venice Biennale] two times in a row.How will you maintain your creativity, reinvent yourself and keep things fresh?I made a decision from the start to focus on more than just one medium, so I do photography, films, sculpture and performance. In between it's easy for me to find slippages, tensions and contradictions that lead to the next work. Show runs until July 8. This article was originally published in The Times.
