Milton Dlamini became the latest PSL coaching casualty after he revealed on Friday that he will part ways with relegation-threatened rookies Baroka FC after just three months in the job.The Baroka co-coach was suspended with immediate effect on Tuesday for "a behaviour which has not pleased the management" but quit three days later despite a supposedly pending disciplinary hearing against him.He denied any misconduct and said instead that he was laid off over "a misunderstanding during a technical team committee meeting".Dlamini confirmed on Friday that he has reached an agreement with his chairman, Khurishi Mphahlele, to leave the club when his contract comes to an end on June 30.Asked if the Baroka chairman tried to convince him to continue with the team into the new season, Dlamini said: "Obviously they can't just let one of their own go without trying to convince him otherwise."I only had a three-month agreement with them and now I can focus on looking for another job."Baroka survived automatic relegation by a whisker on the last day of the season after finishing second from bottom in their maiden PSL campaign.After playing a pivotal role as Baroka narrowly survived, Dlamini would have been heartbroken and in a state of disgust having to watch from the sidelines the team he has been part and parcel of in their remaining 10 games of the season.Despite the ordeal, Dlamini is grateful to his soon-to-be former employer for giving him the opportunity to coach at the highest level of professional football in the country.Having never coached in the Premiership before, Dlamini was basically thrown into the deep end when he was roped in as co-coach with Kgoloko Thobejane in March.Dlamini was this week suspended with immediate effect for "behaviour which has not pleased the management"."I would like to thank the club and the chairman for the confidence they have shown in me." It's been an unforgettable three months of which I am proud to have contributed towards the club avoiding automatic relegation," said Dlamini.Baroka planted one foot back in the Premier League after a hard-fought 2-0 victory over Stellenbosch FC in their penultimate play-off match and are now in total control of their destiny. Bakgaga will now need a point to retain their top flight status when they play their last relegation-promotion play-off match away to provincial rivals Black Leopards on Saturday.
