Nick Favager, the general-merchandise director at Game, said last week that the introduction of sports apparel was a "natural progression" for the retailer."Healthy living has become a huge trend and customers are now wearing sports apparel as casual wear, which is where the range taps in."Our sports department is now a one-stop shop for casual sports participants and fitness enthusiasts," said Favager.Favager said foot traffic was a big driver in category decisions and "sports apparel provides a more frequent purchase opportunity to drive feet for the category".Game has rolled out clothing in 20 of its key stores in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. Although the group will stock other brands, the Everlast apparel brand is exclusive to Game.This is not Game's first foray into clothing. In 2014, the retailer piloted fashion brand George - a brand owned by Walmart-owned UK retailer Asda - with clothing in three pop-up stores and an essentials range in Game stores .Massmart, which was bought by the world's largest retailer, Walmart, in 2011, added groceries to its portfolio in the same year.Peter Takaendesa, a portfolio manager at Mergence Investment Managers, said: "We'll have to judge [the introduction of clothing] based on execution."At the group's recent AGM, CEO Guy Hayward said sales for the first five months of 2017 were disappointing. For the first 21 weeks of this year, Massmart's total sales grew 0.3%, while comparable sales were 1.9% lower. Comparable sales from stores in South Africa were down 0.4% in this period, while outside the country, comparable sales were 15.7% lower.Massdiscounters, the division that includes Game stores and DionWired, saw comparable sales fall 3.3%.Bright Khumalo, a portfolio manager at Vestact, said: "Massmart are coming into a market that is already competitive. We've seen the likes of MRP Sport getting hurt."On whether Takaendesa would advise shareholders to invest in the stock, he said: "The issue now is that Massmart shares are not cheap, for the slow progress that we are seeing. If it was much cheaper then we would get into it."They have some very good brands in the portfolio, it's just that there are major challenges in some areas."
