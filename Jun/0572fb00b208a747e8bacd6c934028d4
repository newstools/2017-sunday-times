The Nutella Caf opened this week in Chicago, serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Naturally, many of its menu items - from cr pes to pastries to oatmeal - are drizzled in the famous chocolate-hazelnut spread.The weird part, though, is the shop's d cor: "It's designed to make you feel like you're actually walking into a jar of Nutella," says Angela Baird of Big Retail, which was involved in creating the space. "Everything screams 'Nutella.'"Meanwhile, in Berlin, the world's first "Hofstel" has opened its doors.What is that, you ask? Well, obviously it's a hostel dedicated to former Baywatch star David Hasselhoff.As the new Baywatch movie releases this week, with Dwayne Johnson playing the character Hasselhoff portrayed on TV for 12 years, Berlin at least wants us all to remember the hairy-chested hero who did it first.The Circus Hostel's tribute features a mini-museum dedicated to the Hoff, now 64, which includes a mural of him, made by a fan and complete with chest hair (shag-pile carpet?) glued onto the wall, framed photos, Baywatch and Knight Rider paraphernalia, and information about his 1989 performance on the Berlin Wall. The Hoff enjoyed a successful pop career in Germany with hits including Looking for Freedom.Weirdly enough, there's also a place called the David Hasselhostel in Budapest, Hungary, though it does not appear to have any Hoff-related d cor.Finally, a budget hotel in London is offering guests the chance to upgrade to a room with a view of some spectacular city landmark for only 1 extra. The catch, however, is that the view is fake.Guests at the Old Street branch of the easyHotel can pay for a fake window that looks out over landmarks like the London Eye, the Gherkin, the Shard, Tower Bridge or Buckingham Palace.The fake view is a picture mounted on a PVC board and attached to the wall with removable adhesive strips. They have to just ask on check-in.Hotel manager Jorge Rodriguez said: "Many London hotels charge rates as high as 10,000 for a premium view from a room. Why shell out a fortune when you could be spending your hard-earned cash on the experience of the city itself?"
