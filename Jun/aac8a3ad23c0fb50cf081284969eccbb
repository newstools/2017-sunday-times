This is according to a new paper published in The New England Journal of Medicine which said the 2.2 billion children and adults worldwide who were overweight or obese constituted 30% of all people.The study also showed an increasing percentage of people die from these health conditions.People were dying even though they were not technically considered obese researchers found.Of the 4 million deaths attributed to excess body weight in 2015 nearly 40% occurred among people whose body mass index (BMI) fell below the threshold considered obese .The authors said the findings represented a growing and disturbing global public health crisis.It found that in South Africa 10 million adults or 30.2% of the adult population were considered obese. Additionally 1.6 million South African children were obese comprising 8.8% of all children in South Africa. People who shrug off weight gain do so at their own risk risk of cardiovascular disease diabetes cancer and other life-threatening conditions said Dr Christopher Murray an author on the study and Director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington.He said those half-serious New Year s resolutions to lose weight should become year-round commitments to lose weight and prevent future weight gain.The study covers 195 countries and territories from 1980 through 2015.It is based on data from the most recent Global Burden of Disease study a systematic scientific effort to quantify the magnitude of health loss from all major diseases injuries and risk factors by age sex and population. The paper includes analyses of other studies on the effects of excess weight and potential links between high BMI and cancers of the esophagus colon and rectum liver gallbladder and biliary tract pancreas breast uterus ovary kidney and thyroid as well as leukemia.
