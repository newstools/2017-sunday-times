This comes after The Times sister publication Sowetan last week reported that Dlodlo was secured accommodation in Dubai by Gupta-owned Sahara Computers. Invoices in the leaked Gupta emails show that though Dlodlo was booked by Sahara Computers her bill was paid for by businessman Fana Hlongwana.Hlongwana was linked to the infamous and costly arms deal where he acted as a middleman during the negotiations. He was employed by BAE Systems which got the contract to supply Hawk and Gripen aircraft to South Africa.Dlodlo confirmed the trip but said she was not aware of Sahara Computers because the trip was an arrangement between her and Hlongwana. She said she was on her way to Jordan when she made the detour.In her affidavit to the committee the DA s Phumzile van Damme requests the committee to initiate a probe into Dlodlo s conduct for failing to declare the trip.Cabinet urges business labour to tackle recession According to the register of members interests it seems to be apparent that Dlodlo failed to disclose the trip and this warrants and investigation by the ethics committee part of the affidavit reads.Parliament s code of conduct prescribes that MPs make disclosures pertaining to travel. The disclosures include description of the journey sponsor s details and value of the trip.Van Damme told The Times that the minister s confirmation of the trip proves the veracity of the leaked Gupta emails. We have followed processes and submitted the affidavit to the committee to investigate this matter. We hope that they will investigate without fear and favour and get to the bottom of this.
