According to the latest figures out of the International Wine and Spirits Research group out of the UK, the global market for alcoholic drinks shrunk by -1.3% in 2016. Compared to the average rate of -0.3% in the previous five years, the decline is increasing at a faster rate than previously projected, analysts say. The main reasons for the drop? A faster decline in beer consumption, a reversal of trends for cider and slowing growth for mixed drinks.After years of enjoying double-digit growth in the US, it seems cider's 15 minutes of fame is up, for example, with volumes collapsing -15%. The same is true in South Africa, where cider has fallen out of popularity after years of double-digit growth.Globally, the consumption of cider shrunk by -1.5% last year.The story's similar for beer, with consumption dropping -1.8% in 2016, compared to the five-year average of -0.6%. The accelerated decline is traced back to three major markets where beer consumption suffered steep drops. In China, consumption dropped -4.2%; Brazil -5.3%; and Russia -7.8%. In the category of spirits, vodka consumption dropped -4.3%, while volumes of tequila, gin and whisky increased between 2% and 5%. Wine consumption was flat, with a modest increased consumption of sparkling wine at 1.8%.Despite the downturn in 2016, analysts predict that alcohol consumption will rise modestly by 0.8% until 2021, thanks in part to whisky, one of the main growth drivers. Likewise, mixed drinks, sparkling wine and beer which is forecast to grow in Asian and sub-Saharan African markets are expected to rise over the next few years.
