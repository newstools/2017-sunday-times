The president of the Association of Black Securities and Investment Professionals (Absip), Sibongiseni Mbatha, says former Liberty CEO Thabo Dloti should have received more support from the board and majority shareholder Standard Bank.Dloti, who was Absip's CEO of the decade in 2013, resigned last week, three years after being appointed as Liberty's first black CEO.Mbatha, who spoke to him afterwards, says he jumped before he was pushed to preserve his integrity.Dloti told Business Times in March harsh words had been exchanged between him and parent company Standard Bank over the group's poor performance. Its earnings plunged 37% in 2016, costing its 54% owner R1.5-billion in headline earnings."Clearly they'd like to see a better outcome," Dloti said.He said Standard Bank joint CEO Sim Tshabalala, a director of Liberty, would be introducing a 10-step turnaround strategy to help the life insurer. Explaining Dloti's departure, Liberty chairman Jacko Maree said the turnaround was not happening fast enough.Mbatha believes Dloti's resignation is a significant setback for transformation, which the financial services sector can ill afford. Only three of the largest listed financial services companies now have a black CEO.His departure comes in the wake of the sudden resignation of senior Barclays Africa executive Phakamani Hadebe in March after he was supposedly overlooked for a top job."Dloti is an astute, competent professional who took over the reins in a company that had not been performing with flying colours for a number of years," says Mbatha."Before him there were Myles Ruck and Bruce Hemphill, and Liberty didn't do well under them either."Mbatha says he is not trying to turn an issue of underperformance into one of transformation."This has to do with the support given by the shareholder and the board to the executive," he says."Our gripe is two things. One, could the board have supported him differently? And two, what was the board's succession plan? Why couldn't they find another black CEO within the Liberty Group?"Standard Bank announced Dloti would be replaced by David Munro, CEO of its corporate and investment banking unit.Mbatha says this is a backward step for transformation, even though Munro's deputy, Kenny Fihla, will succeed him. He says that in addition to Dloti himself, he spoke to Tshabalala and Maree about Dloti's departure: "There was a strategic misalignment between Dloti and the board and shareholder, and he decided that to protect his dignity, integrity and professionalism it would be better if he left."He says he does not believe Maree is anti-transformation: "In 2012, Absip honoured Maree as a transformative leader because he had groomed the likes of Tshabalala and many other black executives to take over key strategic positions in the bank ... We know Jacko as a transformative leader ... [but he and] his board [don't have] a succession plan that ensures that, when a black CEO departs, you get another black CEO."He is also critical of Maree and the Liberty board for not intervening sooner."There should have been an intervention before this thing snowballed into a departure ... What did they do to ensure there was alignment between the board and the CEO before it got to this point? That is the question."Mbatha, who has been highly critical of the slow pace of transformation in the financial services sector, says Barclays Africa missed an important opportunity to accelerate transformation when it failed to appoint Hadebe to succeed Stephen van Coller as head of corporate and investment banking. Twenty black professionals staged a walkout in protest and Hadebe resigned.He says that when Hadebe left the Land Bank to join Barclays Africa there was an expectation, based on his successful turnaround of the Land Bank, that he would succeed Van Coller. He has not spoken to Hadebe, but says they'd been led to believe that Hadebe - who worked with Barclays Africa CEO Maria Ramos at the National Treasury - would get the position."We have many members there and they briefed us on the matter. That he had been led to expect to be CEO and resigned when this did not happen, or when he heard that they were splitting the position."There will now be two heads of corporate and investment banking, rather than one.Mbatha believes this signals a vote of no confidence in the ability of a black executive to do the job."That is distasteful to us. This thing of co-CEOs and co-heads when one person can do the job is a problem issue for us. It doesn't taste well at all."The bank's explanation is that separating the portfolios is "the most optimal option", but Mbatha says he doesn't buy it.Neither is he appeased by the fact that one of the co-heads, Temi Ofong, is a black African."The appointment of a black African as co-CEO of [corporate and investment banking] is not transformation because he is not a South African," he says. However, he says he has no reason to believe that Ramos is antitransformation, either."If she felt he was not the right person for the job, we wouldn't attack her. We would just say to her: 'Phakamani would have done the job.'"He says he doesn't expect banks or corporates to reveal the information on which they base top appointments: We don't want them to say: 'We have appointed this one and not that one because of this or that.'We just want them to appoint in a transformative manner, and ensure there is a transparent succession plan in place that ensures black professionals are included in the upper echelons."In its submission to the recent parliamentary hearings on transformation in the financial services sector, the Banking Association South Africa said most of the key transformation targets set by the financial sector charter had been met."My response is that the targets are too easy," says Mbatha."We would be fooling ourselves to say we had achieved a lot just because those targets have been met. The targets must be reviewed and increased significantly."Basa did concede that progress had been slow at board and executive levels, and that the number of black executives and black women in senior management positions had fallen short of the targets.Mbatha says he hopes the central message of the report that comes out of the hearings will be that the sector must transform faster so that appointments reflect the demographics of South Africa as soon as possible.Basa conceded that black appointments at executive and board level were going backwards. "Shareholders have been too busy counting revenue and profits to give more support to transformation," says Mbatha. He agrees, however, that profits are a necessary condition for transformation, which is why he believes South Africa's junk status will impede transformation. He says the target of 26% black ownership of banks needs to be met as a matter of urgency.Questions have been raised about the difficulty of calculating black ownership when black shareholders are not necessarily long term and their holdings fluctuate along with those of other shareholders: "Banks need to watch this and make sure that once black shareholdings drop below the target they do another empowerment transaction," he says.In its submission, Basa said a choice must be made between financing black ownership and increasing financing in the economy.Mbatha says Absip has proposed a black business growth fund to which entities that black shareholders have exited can contribute in lieu of doing another empowerment transaction.The money would be used to fund black- and woman-owned enterprises within and outside the financial services sector, he says.Mbatha, 41, is an economist by training who worked at Standard Bank and Absa before joining the Industrial Development Corporation 10 years ago.
