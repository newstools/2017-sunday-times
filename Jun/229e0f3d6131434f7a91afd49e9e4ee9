The Portugal superstar's opener was cancelled out by an astonishing Mario Mandzukic strike, but goals from Casemiro, Ronaldo and Marco Asensio secured Madrid's third Champions League triumph in four years and 12th in total.Now a four-time Champions League winner, Ronaldo finished as the competition's top scorer for the fifth season running, substantially enhancing his chances of matching eternal rival Lionel Messi's tally of five Ballons d'Or.Zinedine Zidane, a head coach for only 17 months, became the first manager to oversee back-to-back European Cup successes since Arrigo Sacchi's fabled AC Milan team won the tournament in 1989 and 1990.It crowns a glorious season for Madrid, who have pulled off a La Liga and European Cup double for the first time since 1958, having also won the Club World Cup and European Super Cup.Zidane's triumph was his former club Juve's misery, Massimiliano Allegri's side crashing to a fifth successive defeat in Champions League finals and seventh in total, extending their own desperately unwanted record.The Italian champions also had substitute Juan Cuadrado sent off after he was shown a second yellow card for a gentle push on Sergio Ramos that drew a comical overreaction from the Madrid skipper.
