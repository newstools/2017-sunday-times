Seven-time world MotoGP champion Rossi was only given the green light to compete in his home race late this week after he was hospitalised by a painful collision with his motocross machine when he fell while training last week."My condition is improving day by day and this allows me to think a bit more positively about Mugello," the 38-year-old, who is third in the championship standings, 23 points behind pace setter Vi ales, told Motorsport.com."I'm not 100% and I'm finding it a little hard to breathe, but I went for a ride and it went well," said Rossi, who hurt his ribs when falling on the handlebars."The chief worry is if I can hold out throughout a long race with all those turns where you have to take deep breaths."But frankly I'm lucky to be here, I could easily have broken something and it's great to be at Mugello."The Italian will not be riding at full fitness throughout the weekend, but Johann Zarco, a podium finisher in his last outing in Le Mans, believes his intimate experience of the track and Yamaha's M1 should negate any physical obstacles in his way."With the experience that he has; to know the bike perfectly; to know the track perfectly - he can manage the practice tomorrow, try to rest the energy and for sure he can surprise us in the race," said the Frenchman, before saying, "Never think that Rossi is down!"Rossi's teammate Maverick Vi ales was another to talk up the Italian's chances, stating the energy transmitted by an enthusiastic home support can push him on to a sterling result."For sure he's going to try," said Vi ales, the current championship leader by 17 points."We hope that Valentino can recover and can be at 100% for the race. It's something that we hope; that no one gets injured."Let's see how it goes but if he's not at 100% for sure all the fans can make him go at the limit."Dani Pedrosa was another rider to be asked about Rossi's weekend potential. While the Spaniard believes the physical demands of Mugello's high-speed layout will be a hindrance, the nine-time world champion's will in front of a home crowd can push him on.Pedrosa said: "[There are] A lot of fans and he knows the track very well. But MotoGP is always a very hard race too so at this moment we don't know. We'll see in the practice but for sure the will to be there is there so why not?"
