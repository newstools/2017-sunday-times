Just as you might order a glass of Bordeaux at a restaurant in Europe you can now order a glass of Cape Town after a new wine of origin district named after the city was approved on Thursday by the South African Wine and Spirit Board.Thirty wineries in Constantia Durbanville Philadelphia and Hout Bay will join forces under the banner Wine of Origin Cape Town aiming to capitalise on the global recognition the city has achieved as a tourist destination and lifestyle brand. The collaboration between the various wards and wineries in coming together to form the new wine district is a huge step forward for the South African wine industry said Rico Basson CEO of wine producers organisation Vinpro. As a wine region Cape Town now encapsulates a wonderful set of dynamics in terms of heritage culture and modern wine styles. Duimpie Bayly chairman of the wine and spirit board demarcation committee said: We considered the various wards in the new proposed district and found great similarity in terroir as well as clear boundaries in a district that at its furthest point is 36km from the Cape Town city centre. We looked at the marketing potential of the new district but remained scientific in determining the physical similarities of the wards. Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde said the development would increase global awareness of South African wine. This is exciting news for our wine industry. Cape Town s brand as a leading quality tourism and investment destination is already well established. Bringing our wine offering under this same banner is a natural fit and one which will dramatically accelerate global market recognition of our produce. This move will deliver benefits to both our tourism and wine industries. - TMG Digital
