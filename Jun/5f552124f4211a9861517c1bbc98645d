It is the next grim act by a stubborn man who refuses to recognise that the greater good is more important than short-term gains for immediate self-interest and instant satisfaction.The Paris accord sets out considered and globally agreed goals to stop the average global temperature from increasing by a projected 2 C, which would trigger huge and probably cataclysmic climate change.Of course there is debate on the extent to which climate change can be halted or retarded by humans. But surely no one can argue that everyone must do what they can to preserve the planet? And it is on this point that Trump fails so dismally.Given the size and nature of the US economy and its consumer-driven society, that nation's role in efforts to limit climate change is enormous. Trump's actions again show the baseness and callous self-centredness of the man. Those who hoped the selfish, childish, unthinking and populist attitudes he exhibited during the election campaign were only displayed so he could win the presidency must think again. Trump is what he said he was, and he'll do what he said he would in order to satisfy the immediate whims and desires of the ignorant, no matter what the medium- to long-term cost, especially to anyone outside the US. In this case, he has used the populist argument that withdrawing from the Paris accord is in the interest of protecting American jobs.But in the long run, on all available and scientifically accepted evidence, his actions will harm the Earth, the only home all human beings including the US's blue-collar workers have. It is a matter of choosing short-term political gain over massive harm. That, however, is an ethical point Trump either does not understand or does not care about.
