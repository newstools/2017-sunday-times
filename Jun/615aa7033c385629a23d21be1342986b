It s bright and full of beautiful pictures, anecdotes and recipes that will transport you to another continent.She tells us more.The origin of the book really lies in two things: my complete love of good food and a decision taken by my husband and me - after many years of "normal" life - to resign from our serious jobs, put all our earthly possessions into storage and buy two tickets to travel the world for a year ... starting in Mexico.There is something absolutely magical about the Latin American world we found ourselves in and, as the months passed, we grew less and less enthusiastic about being anywhere else on earth.This is a region in which the Maya, Aztec, Inca, Spanish and Portuguese made their contribution before being more broadly influenced by immigration from Africa, the Caribbean, Asia and Europe. This has resulted in a complex layering of flavours and techniques that leaves one in a constant state of culinary amazement.As I jotted down an ever-increasing list of dishes that compelled me to take them home, it became clear that I had secrets to share with others who had not yet explored this region.The purpose of the cookbook is not to simply replicate traditional recipes but to adapt them to the practicalities of life beyond Latin America, where certain ingredients are difficult to find. Despite these adaptations, I believe they maintain the magic that encouraged me to share them.TRY THESE RECIPES FROM 'A BITE OF LATIN AMERICA' Plump Mexican corn pockets with saucy fillings (Gorditas) Mexican fish baked in olive &amp; tomato sauce (Pescado a la Veracruzana) Brazilian corn cake (Bolo De Fuba) 'A bite of Latin America' by Susie Chatz-Anderson is published by Human &amp; Rousseau, R340.
