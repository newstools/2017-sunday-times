After an unconvincing win and a defeat, they won 12-3 against the Crusaders in Christchurch.Flyhalf Owen Farrell slotted four penalties in a match where all the points came from kicks.Along with Farrell's boot, it was the tourists' defence that won the match.These qualities will help to build momentum ahead of the first test on June 24."We can be pleased with our defence. We probably need to be more clinical when we do get line breaks, but we are happy with our turnaround," said Lions match captain Alun Wyn Jones.Richie Mo'unga kicked a first-half penalty for the only points for the Crusaders, who have claimed seven Super Rugby titles and won all 14 of their games in the competition this season."We didn't have our rhythm," said Crusaders captain and All Blacks lock Sam Whitelock.Scrumhalf Conor Murray and Farrell sent strong messages that they should be the starting Lions halfback combination for the first test. Their attacking kicking game put immense pressure on the Crusaders.The tourists also shut down the Crusaders' attacking options, forcing them into mistakes.The Lions, however, suffered two injuries with fullback Stuart Hogg receiving a bad cut above his left eye when he accidentally collided with Murray's elbow while chasing a high kick.Centre Jonathan Davies, making his first appearance on the tour, also failed a head injury assessment when he was tackled heavily by Mo'unga.The battle between the packs had been seen as crucial with the Crusaders having six All Blacks forwards in their starting side, including the likely starting test front row.French referee Mathieu Raynal, however, did not allow any momentum to develop and caused a great deal of confusion with some of his decisions.
