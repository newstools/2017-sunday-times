Too many conflicting designs in an array of different colours can look overwhelming, giving a room a chaotic feel. A scheme that's too matchy-matchy, on the other hand, can fall flat. Here's how to remedy these and other common decorating mistakes so you can mix and match patterns like a pro:Mistake 1: not adding solid colour to the mixDon t overdo patterns, especially when you re starting out mix them with solids to get a good balance that doesn t overwhelm the eye.Mistake 2: sticking to a single pattern sizePlay with different size patterns so that they don t compete with each other. For a real wow effect, you could mix a large floral with a medium geometric and a small classic pattern.That said, if you re new to pattern, or fairly conservative, stick to one style in varying sizes.Mistake 3: having no unifying colour paletteColour is really important, so before you choose your patterns, decide on a colour palette that works for you. Once you re happy with your selection, search for patterns within those hues.Remember that intensity is as important as hue, so if you re going for bold jewel tones, steer clear of pastels.Mistake 4: decorating with even numbers Odd numbers have a way of balancing out, so if you re combining colours and patterns, try a mix of, for example, three patterns and three colours. Avoid fours, sixes, etc.Mistake 5: not considering scaleIt may sound obvious, but small patterns work best on small items and large patterns on large pieces. So, for example, save your delicate hounds tooth for a small scatter and go wild with huge florals on your curtains.Mistake 6: shying away from making a statementMake a feature out of your pattern you could opt for a bold wall or a patterned rug in a central position, which will be sure to attract the eye.Mistake 7: not repeating patternsUsing the same pattern in various parts of a room will help create a unified and planned look. Tie your look together with accessories. For instance, if you've used a bold print on the headboard in your bedroom, consider adding a scatter in the same pattern to an armchair.
