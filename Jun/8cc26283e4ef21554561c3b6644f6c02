"Making the right career choice ... can be just as confusing now as in previous generations," says Tracy Borland, a recruitment consultant at Suncoast Casino, Hotels and Entertainment.In fact, she says, the process may be even harder now as the list of possible careers expands to include growth hackers, social-media influencers and app developers."Statistics also show that the average person changes jobs 10 to 15 times in a lifetime. That's an average of 12 job changes in one's full career, and that statistic is expected to grow according to the trends of generations Y and Z," she says.Borland has the following advice on how to choose a career: Be honest about your strengths and weaknesses as well as your values and skills. Do not set your heart on being an engineer if maths is your worst subject, or a tour guide if you are not a people's person; Draw up a list of the careers you like, to simplify the process of choosing a career. Think about people you know, TV programmes and the things you wanted to do when you were a child; and Set career goals. If you see running a busy restaurant as your ultimate job, you need to focus on that industry rather than wasting time in other places that are unlikely to lead you to your dream job.
