Last month she ran a second event at Little Havana in Umhlanga. Patrons were invited to dress in black and white with a touch of sparkle in a nod to the Durbanville Hills Sparkling Sauvignon welcome drink.The event ran over two nights. Both occasions were sold out.The first Come Wine With Us - the one on the farm - comprised 30 hand-picked friends and family. "It's become," she says, "what I always dreamt it would be. A food and wine community where we break bread, share a glass of wine and actually connect with one another."Doms describes Come Wine With Us as the "ultimate foodie experience" that brings together wine estates, restaurants and patrons.She runs regular events in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Pretoria and now Durban.Each city is unique, she says, and Johannesburg was initially a challenge."But now when I get off the plane I get into the vibe of the city. I find what makes people tick fascinating - how they look at brands, what they like to drink, how they socialise, shop and so on."Doms focused on building her base in Cape Town and then in Johannesburg where the brands sell most of their wines. She runs monthly events in these two cities. Pretoria and Durban fall into what she terms "the second tier".Her business model is simple, she says. "If I don't get people to attend my events the brand does not lose out; I lose out. Hence we need to always keep them fresh and relevant. It's hard work but it keeps us on our toes."Doms studied at the Institute of Culinary Arts in the Cape and was awarded a sommelier scholarship to Waddesdon Manor in the UK, but believes her greatest advantage came from growing up in the food and wine community of Robertson where today many of her friends are wine farmers."I like to make others feel good and I get to eat and drink for a living. I love every minute of it." Visit comewinewithus.co.za to find out about upcoming events in your city. This article was originally published in The Times.
