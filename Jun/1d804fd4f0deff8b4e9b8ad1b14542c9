Both are phenomenally talented batsmen, handy offspinners and excellent fielders.However, the comparisons don't end there.They haven't done justice to their God-given talents. In the course of his 15-year international career from 1987 to 2002, Hooper averaged 36.46 in tests and 35.34 in one-day internationals (ODI) in a combined 329 international matches.With career averages of 33.64 (tests) and 37.47 (ODI) in 219 matches since his ODI debut in Sri Lanka in 2004, you could say Duminy is South Africa's Hooper.The levels of patience shown in Duminy have been rewarded with sporadic excellence interspersed with regular mediocrity.An example has been his last 20 ODI innings, which have realised only 524 runs at an average of 25.4 with three 50s and a highest of 82.Former Proteas teammate, now Cape Cobras coach and the man who made way for him in Perth, Australia, nine years ago to make his astounding test debut, Ashwell Prince, said Duminy is not done.He said the fact Duminy didn't take part in the Indian Premier League to work on his game ahead of the England tour is a sign of his intent and his willingness to fight for his place."JP has put in a lot of work in the month leading up to the tour and he also didn't take part in the IPL in a bid to ensure he will be firing for the national team. He's committed to working with us on certain specifics in his game in Cape Town. For him, it is an opportunity. When you get to a certain stage of your career, you realise one more ICC tournament could be your last. There's the chance of making a big impact in terms of winning a trophy," Prince said."He really wants to do well in the tournament and he wanted to be there fresh. With the length of the IPL and the travelling, you're bound to be tired because of the vastness of the country."At 33, Duminy is at a stage where his talent alone can no longer speak for itself.The likes of David Miller and the talented bunch of young allrounders coming through will make it difficult for Duminy to justify his place if style continues to trump the substance needed to make good on his potential.Prince said Duminy still has some international cricket left in him even if he doesn't do well at the Champions Trophy. "I was still playing when I was 38, so I still think he has five more years to offer."He can still last and I do think he'll want to contribute to the national cause from a trophy-winning perspective because those opportunities aren't going to come around often."
