Q. I am 18 years old. I was born with HIV and am finding it difficult to get information on how to go about my sex life. Do I have rights?A. The number of people born with HIV who are now young adults is growing. The triad of sexual health, sexual pleasure and sexual rights is an important concept.Many young people in South Africa have been exposed to campaigns and public health communications across television, radio and print, with their focus on prevention of HIV.The abstinence-only message has no place. Content for young people should deal with questions like what constitutes consent for sex and how to reduce the risk of infection from all types of sexually transmitted disease, not just HIV.Young people require assistance and guidance on how to have open discussions with their sexual partners on issues such as whose responsibility it is to ensure condom use, safe storage of condoms, and which lubricant to use.Some of their needs may include assistance and support with disclosure of their health status to their sexual partners. Many will require couple counselling, especially if their sexual partner does not have HIV.This type of sexual health information can help them to make informed decisions.The World Health Organisation recognises that "the fulfilment of sexual health is tied to the extent to which human rights are respected, protected and fulfilled". The many young people in South Africa who are living with HIV must be supported in this respect.
