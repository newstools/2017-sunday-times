Called Frankees the range will be launched with Kolisi's friend Tim Whitehead. The two friends both hail from Port Elizabeth. I want to wear a pair of undies that gives the Boys the same support as my team gives me that is comfortable and looks good in any situation on or off the field said Kolisi. We feel the underwear game in South Africa is pretty bland at the moment and many resort to Australian and Euro markets to get their funky pieces. We want to be loud down below and allow guys the sense of pride in what they wear under their pants. Kolisi was hands-on in designing the funky 95% cotton collection which has an African flair along with a retro-1990s waistband. One design will use South Africa s national flower the protea while another incorporates traditional ShweShwe and a playful emoji print.Whitehead said: The journey has been one of many lessons and challenges but an adventure none the less. We are proud of the designs we have come up with and the quality exceeds all of our expectations."Frankees are produced in Durban by Ninian and Lester which also manufactures for Jockey. Prices range from R200 to R230 per piece and they will shortly be available worldwide with international shipping. - HeraldLIVE
