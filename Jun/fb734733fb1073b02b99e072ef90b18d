But there is a reason for the astronomical price. This is no ordinary lamb on the spit.At R37 000 the carcass that will revolve over hot coals on Saturday afternoon is the most expensive in the country. The champion lamb was bred in Mpumulanga and put up for auction at the annual Pietermaritzburg Royal Agricultural Show.Heated bidding saw the free range grass-fed hormone-free meat reach R1 350 per kilogram. The current market rate for lamb is around R67 per kg. The Oyster Box advertised the spit braai as A Cut Above the Rest".Coetzer who was accompanied by executive chef Kevin Joseph said the bidding was vicious . We were up against four others at the end but we were determined to get the very best for our customers. At R300 per kg less than what they paid for the champion lamb last year Coetzer considered it a bargain . We are setting up tables for the lunch on the veranda of the Oyster Box s Lighthouse Bar on Saturday. The price includes salads desserts and the diners choice of top of the range wines beer and soft drinks. The process will be overseen by Joseph. If anything goes wrong with the preparation of the costly carcass the executive chef will be taking the lead role on the spit next year added Coetzer.Also on offer will be chops from a super lamb which went for R275 per kilo at the auction. - TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
