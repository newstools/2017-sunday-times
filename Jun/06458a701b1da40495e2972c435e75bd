Today there are an estimated 113,000 San who live in the region, predominantly in Namibia and Botswana and, to a lesser extent, in South Africa.Weinberg had studied the San at university and was aware of their special relationship with nature, survival skills and their hunter-gatherer existence.But nothing could have prepared him for what he saw when he first visited these communities in 1984. Many of the San men in Eastern Bushmanland, Namibia and Angola, had been recruited by apartheid South Africa to fight against the South West African People's Organisation (Swapo), which was battling for independence.Back then, Weinberg saw a society under severe pressure, grappling to hold onto its land, way of life, culture and values. The conversion of a people's way of life from one dependent on the land to one reliant on wages from the South African army presented sad and traumatic scenes.Waves of settler encroachment increased the pressure, while greed and short-sighted policies further eroded the San's existence.Weinberg's portraits document this and other stories.
