What is questionable though, is why female superheroes require so much visible flesh to save the world, when a male hero like Batman is covered from head to toe in thick, black, impenetrable armour - a practical outfit for battling villains.Wonder Woman, on the other hand, runs around in thigh-high platform wedges, a strapless corset, a blue snakeskin crotch duster and a metal headband.Despite exposing plenty of skin, she wears an outfit that at least protects her squidgy bits. Other female heroes haven't been quite as lucky.Though Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow and Anne Hathaway as Cat Woman got to wear pretty protective gear, there are a few female superheroes whose outfits leave even less to the imagination than Wonder Woman's.From the DC stable comes Kara Zor-L, alias Karen Starr, aka Power Girl (pictured above). Though she possesses powers like super strength and flight, her real power surely comes from distracting opponents with her incredible cleavage - conveniently displayed through the ''boob window" in her costume. She also has super speed, freeze breath and super-hearing - all the better to hear her opponents praise her feminist credentials under their breath.Emma Frost (pictured below) is a comic character appearing in the Marvel Comics stable who's associated with the X-Men story. January Jones, who played the White Queen in X-Men: First Class, wore clothes in some of her scenes. But the original comic book character forgoes a costume in favour of a few napkin-sized pieces of cloth and a strand of dental floss or two for her rambunctious fights with Wolverine.The good vampire (pictured below) has powers that include super-strength, super-speed and hyper-human senses, Her stare and voice are hypnotic to males - surely that has got nothing to do with her mono-kini made of red floss.
