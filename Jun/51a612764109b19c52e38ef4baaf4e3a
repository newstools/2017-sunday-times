There was no objection to a public hearing into some of the circumstances around a 2013 South African Airways plan to buy planes from Airbus‚ the Companies Tribunal heard on Monday. Legal representatives for SAA chairwoman Dudu Myeni and the Companies and Intellectual Properties Commission (CIPC) said they had no objection to the media being present and recording proceedings. Pressure has been mounting on Myeni and it was expected her lawyers would try to block the hearing from being public. Myeni's legal team is arguing that the compliance notice issued to her by the CIPC in November 2016 should be declared invalid because the proper process was not followed. Her lawyer Francois van Zyl said Myeni had complied "under protest". The bid to have the compliance notice declared invalid was launched months ago and was seen as an attempt to clean up Myeni's record ahead of Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba's decision on her one-year contract as chairwoman of the board‚ which expires in September. However‚ reflecting the speed of political developments‚ Gigaba on Thursday told journalists that Myeni's contract would not be renewed. Myeni was not present at the hearing. -BusinessLIVE
