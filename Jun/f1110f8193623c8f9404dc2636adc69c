There's also the second edition of the festival's Virtual Encounters Exhibition, which shines a spotlight on the gains being made in the field of virtual reality. Here are a few picks for you to watch out for at this year's festival:Director: Pascal LamacheThe Mother of the Nation is a divisive figure in South African conversation and here she sets the record straight, with her daughters and commentators and players such as Dali Mpofu, Neil Barnard and former security policeman Vic McPherson. It reminds us of Madikizela-Mandela's undeniable contribution to the struggle and the indignities she suffered both at the hands of the apartheid state and later at those of her husband and the ANC.Director: Raoul PeckPeck's examination of writer and activist James Baldwin's hard-hitting analysis of race relations in the US, through the reading of an unpublished manuscript, is a depressing but relevant look at how little things have changed since Baldwin's death in 1987. Narrated by Samuel L Jackson and featuring archive footage of Baldwin's public appearances and work in the Civil Rights movement, it's a poignant testimony to one of the 20th century's clearest thinkers and an elegy for the lack of heed paid to his warnings about race relations.WATCH the trailer for I Am Not Your Negro Director: Daniel ZimblerWhile many journalists have interviewed legendary South African photographer David Goldblatt, few have been permitted access to his working process. Zimbler takes us behind the scenes with Goldblatt on the road as the 86-year-old photographer shares his thoughts on his upbringing, his development as an artist, his photographic process and his aging. It's a moving look into the mind of one of the world's most recognised and celebrated photographers.Director: Vincent MoloiThe decimation of the Herero and Nama peoples of Namibia by Germany is considered one of the earliest genocides of the 20th century. Vincent Moloi follows Herero chiefs and activists as they battle to maintain the dignity of their people in their search for acknowledgement of responsibility from today's German government. The film also raises bigger issues such as access to land and financial aid which have been central to the relationship between Germany and independent Namibia and which have prevented the Herero and Nama from getting the justice they deserve.Director: Sifiso KhanyileYou may think you know everything about the history of the 1976 Soweto uprisings but Khanyile's film, by situating the events within the cultural, political and social influence of the Black Consciousness movement and focusing on the subsequent protests in Bonteheuwel, Langa and the Cape Flats, provides insightful analysis. Featuring fascinating interviews with members of the movement, the film recasts these pivotal events in a revealing context.Director: Maya ZishteinThe story of what happened when two Arab players from Chechnya were introduced into the 2013 season squad of Beitar Jerusalem, Israel's most popular, unapologetically racist and right-wing football team, is a sickening indictment of violent, stubbornly blind and frightening attitudes that permeate the country beyond the walls of stadiums and casts a dark cloud of shame on people who should have known better.
