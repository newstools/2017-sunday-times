On the coast of central Vietnam, a few minutes from the small town of Hoi An, Cua Dai Beach offers beach-bound holidaymakers the best value for money. Here, a day at the beach costs $13.18/R171.66, according to the annual TravelBird global Beach Price Index. The Beach Price Index takes into account the cost of a tube of sunscreen, a beer, a bottle of water, an ice cream and lunch at 310 beaches in over 70 countries. Note that the ranking doesn't include the price of hiring a sun lounger, although this doesn't always come with a cost in certain countries. Such is the case in Vietnam, where simply ordering a drink will secure you a place on the shores of the South China Sea. The three beaches offering the best value for money are, in fact, in Vietnam: Northern Europe has a strong presence at the other end of the scale. Kristiansand beach, in Vest-Agder county, Norway, is the most expensive beach, notably due to the price of lunch ($27.37/R356.41). In total, the cost comes in at $64.61/R841.35 for a day on the shore of the North Sea, looking out to Denmark. The top three most expensive beaches are all in Norway, followed by Mareto Plage Publique on the island of Moorea in French Polynesia in fourth.
