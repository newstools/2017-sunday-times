Makes: 1 loaf Ingredients:1 x 385g can condensed milk3 eggs, lightly beaten180ml ( cup) coconut milk250ml (1 cup) instant polenta125ml ( cup) coconut oil1 x 400g can whole kernel corn, not sweetcorn, well drained10ml (2 tsp) baking powderMethod:1) Preheat the oven to 190 C. Only once the oven has reached this temperature proceed with preparing the cake as it must go into the oven immediately.2) Grease a 1-litre loaf or ring pan.3) Beat all the ingredients, except the baking powder, together in a food processor. Once well combined and the corn has been roughly chopped, add the baking powder and beat a little more.4) Immediately after processing, pour the mixture into the prepared pan and place immediately into the heated oven.5) Bake for 45 minutes. To test if cooked, insert a skewer into the centre. If still very liquid, switch off the oven and leave the cake in the cooling oven for 15-20 minutes. It is, however, important to avoid overcooking the cake as it should remain very moist.6) Remove the cake from the pan by turning it over onto a wire rack to cool.
