"There's always a battle between practicality and fantasy when designing costumes for a superhero," Hemming says,The last Wonder Woman was Lynda Carter in 1975 (pictured below). She wore star-spangled hotpants, a flammable-looking cape and a corset so exposing that she could easily bust out during a battle. By contrast, Wonder Woman 2.0 wears armour and, while she's still got a lot of skin on show, she's at least got a solid-looking shield."We're living in a different age," says Hemming. "I tried to make the costumes look like the women were sporty, I didn't want them to look like they were overwhelmed by their costume and couldn't do anything. She's strong and tough but she needs to be comfortable - she's a warrior who has to run through mud and snow."As such, Wonder Woman's wardrobe staple, the corset, is now armour - a gilded leather piece handcrafted by Patrick Whitaker and Keir Malem."I'd worked with them creating a costume for Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider," Hemming says. "They take my drawings and mould the leather onto her body."Whitaker and Malem say: "We've been making formed leather bustiers and gilets for 30 years. We worked with Alexander McQueen on his first Givenchy couture show and on Hussein Chalayan and Giles Deacon's collections. We made all the armour costumes for the film covering the whole of the Themyscira part relating to Wonder Woman's origins. We built about 160 costumes."Wonder Woman is an ''origins story" in superhero land, tracing the character's past and how she went from being Princess Diana of Themyscira to become Wonder Woman. Discovering that ancient plate of armour is an integral part of the story, but for Hemming creating a wider imaginary world and developing the looks that live in it was the most fun."Gal loved her costumes, varying from armour to fussy dresses. My favourite was a beautiful blue dress which I designed, with a sword hidden down the back." - The Daily Telegraph This article was originally published in The Times.
