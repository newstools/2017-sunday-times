After several delays and a plate full of teasers, the southern hip hop icon has finally blessed us with a full-length album, and it's everything we've come to expect from Banner and more.Anyone familiar with Banner will know that, in Twitter parlance, he is ''all the way woke". His opinions on the subject of race relations and black consciousness are the kinds that keep "white genocide" believers tossing and turning at night. It's not surprising then that The God Box sounds like a strident call for African Americans to cut the ankle off the systems standing on their necks.The album's production aggressively frames Banner's pro-black message, leaving little room for doubt that he's not the one you want to poke with a stick. On Elvis Presley, he tackles the appropriation of black music by white artists over an explosive beat that one could easily imagine as a twerking anthem if you swapped out the lyrics.He takes exception to Robin Thicke, Adele and Miley Cyrus unduly benefiting from African American culture as well. His flair for production is what makes The God Box stand out from other "conscious" rap , where the tendency is to have beats that sound like they were conceived in a low-budget studio clouded by incense smoke. Banner, whose production skills are iconic, has managed to craft an album that's full of masculine flair, much like a bicep with Polynesian tattoos.You'd be forgiven for thinking that The God Box's ferociously pro-black sentiment means it's staunchly anti-white, but that would be inaccurate.Instead, the album is an exhortation for black people, and even Australian aborigines, to realise the power within themselves. Like Malcolm X, Banner is not suggesting we get rid of the melanin-deficient, but rather that black people become pugnacious in defence of their humanity and regal in their understanding of their potential.LISTEN to David Banner's Magnolia, featuring CeeLo Green and Raheem DeVaughn 1) Magnolia, featuring CeeLo Green and Raheem DeVaughn2) Who Want It, featuring Black Thought and WatchtheDuck3) Traffic on Mars, featuring KapG, WatchtheDuck, Tim Wise and Kenya Jori4) Wizdom Selah5) Evil Knievil 'The God Box' is available on Apple Music and Google Play This article was originally published in The Times.
