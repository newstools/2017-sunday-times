Use your common sense.3) Stay away from areas where there are known to be adverse conditions. If this is unavoidable, there is a possibility you may to stuck for extended periods, so remember to take extra blankets, appropriate clothing and refreshments, and ensure your tank has enough fuel for the journey.4) Keep your cellphone charged in case of an emergency or make sure you have a charger in the car.5) Switch on your headlights, especially when natural light is low.
