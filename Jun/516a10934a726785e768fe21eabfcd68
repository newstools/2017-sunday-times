Durbanites are known for not attending big events‚ but it seems the magic of Disney has made them buck that trend. Ticket sales for Wonderful World of Disney on Ice have gone so well that there’s an extra performance of the ice-travaganza. An additional show has been added for Thursday‚ July 13 at 10am at Durban’s International Convention Centre. The Wonderful World of Disney on Ice‚ which opens in Johannesburg on June 30‚ is being staged in Durban for the first time. “Ticket sales for Disney On Ice in Durban have surpassed all expectations and outperformed sales in record time. Tickets are on sale at Computicket and there are special family packages on offer‚” said Tony Feldman of Showtime Management. The show includes favourites such as Mickey Mouse‚ Minnie Mouse‚ Donald Duck and Goofy on a walk down memory lane with Dory‚ Nemo and Marlin from Disney-Pixar’s Finding Dory as well as Anna‚ Elsa and Olaf from Frozen. Old favourites from the classics include Rapunzel‚ Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs‚ Buzz and Woody‚ Aladdin and Simba‚ Timon and Pumba. Ice skating husband and wife duo‚ Konrad and Yolande Giering‚ from Pretoria‚ who have toured with the show for more than eight years‚ are looking forward to performing in South Africa for the first time. “Each time Disney on Ice played in South Africa‚ we had been performing in shows in other parts of the world. It is amazing to be in front of your countrymen and friends and family. I have never heard of shows being sold out so fast‚” said Konrad. Yolande features in various roles‚ while Konrad plays Scar in The Lion King and Kristoff in Frozen.
