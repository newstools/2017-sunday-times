The party has looked the other way as apparent proof piles up of how President Jacob Zuma and cronies have sullied the institution of government.Those who have raised their voices inside the party have been drowned out by those who appear to benefit from the corrupt arrangement, at the centre of which are Zuma and the Gupta family.But if things are going badly for the ANC, they are hardly better for the opposition DA, which many voters had seen as a possible alternative to ANC rule, as shown by the party's strong showing in the local elections and its subsequent, and surprising, tie-up with Julius Malema's EFF.This is a great pity as South Africans are yearning for fresh ideas on how to bring the country back in line with the high ideals outlined in the constitution. Practically, too, they want action to drag the economy out of the doldrums, create jobs and to provide quality education, an efficient health system and a safe environment in a crime-ridden society.Instead of grabbing the opportunity, however, the DA is tearing itself apart. The fallout over Western Cape premier Helen Zille's behaviour, arising from her obstinacy over her "colonialism" tweets, may yet have far-reaching consequences that could tilt the balance in the ANC's favour.Already the EFF is threatening to withdraw the votes that helped the DA take control of major metros. This will add to the drama that is unfolding in the Nelson Mandela Bay metro, where mayor Athol Trollip and his deputy, Mongameli Bobani, are at each other's throats.The DA's own poll shows that Zille's tweets offended black voters, and the party's support among this constituency has dwindled.But Zille's supporters will not take her axing lying down. Her caucus in the Western Cape is at least 98% behind her, which means that should the party deal harshly with her, it risks isolating the majority of its members in the legislature.Because Zille remains popular in some parts of the country, those voters who support her stance are likely to seek a new political home should she be booted out of the party.Whether Zille gets the axe or escapes with a slap on the wrist, major damage has already been done.The irony is that having done so much to bring the DA into the political mainstream, Zille now risks destroying all that good work, not to mention her own legacy.So the prospects of having a strong, united opposition come 2019 are fading by the day.This plays into the hands of those within the ruling party who are opposed to clearing out the rot. A crippled opposition will not stand a chance, even when faced with a wounded ANC.The DA owes it to all of South Africa to deal swiftly and decisively with the Zille matter. It has dragged on for too long, giving voters the impression that the party is divided and not up to the challenge of offering an opposition option when the big decision is made in 2019.
