Serves: 12 Ingredients:250ml (1 cup) masa harina or instant polenta250ml (1 cup) very warm water (add cup more if using instant polenta)60g butter, softened5ml (1 tsp) salt80ml ( cup) all-purpose/plain flour5ml (1 tsp) baking powderA little vegetable oil for frying (you can omit this if using a non-stick pan)To serve (suggestions):Spicy mince, spring onions, grated cheese, refried beans, potato cubes slow-cooked in your favourite tomato-based pasta sauce, mild grilled chillies, roasted chicken, sauces or salsasMethod:1) Mix the masa harina or instant polenta with the water. 2) Once well mixed, knead in the butter, salt, flour and baking powder. Add a little more water if necessary to form a dough that holds together.3) Knead the dough on a floured surface until smooth. 4) Divide into 10-12 pieces, roll into balls and leave to rest on a plate covered with plastic wrap for 10-20 minutes.5) Once rested, pat into discs of about 6cm in diameter and 1-2cm thick, smoothing the edges if they crack as you work.6) Place in a heated cast-iron or non-stick pan over medium heat. Cook for a few minutes before flipping over. Repeat until slightly golden on both sides.7) Remove to a wire rack to cool while the remaining gorditas are being cooked.8) Once all the gorditas are cooked, you can either cool them down completely and keep them in the fridge until needed, or crisp them up for serving.9) To crisp up the gorditas, heat 2cm of oil in a heavy pan. When extremely hot, add one gordita at a time, turning them a few times until slightly golden and cooked through. This should take about 2-4 minutes per gordita. Remove and drain on paper towel.10) Create a small slit through which you can fill the gorditas. A few fillings are suggested, but please do not be limited by these.
