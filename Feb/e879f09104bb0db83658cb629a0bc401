Today, 765 independent schools are members of the Independent Schools Association of Southern Africa (Isasa), the largest body representing private schools in the region.The increase has been triggered by the continued rise in urbanisation, which has placed enormous pressure on the public schooling system.According to World Bank data, 65% of South Africans live in the five major cities now, up from 47% in 1960."In many ways education is becoming big business," said Isasa CEO Lebogang Montjane. Listed education groups offer lessons in how to invest wiselyHalf of the association's member schools are in Gauteng, followed by the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal."Independent schools generally go, as one would expect, with prosperity."Montjane said starting a school was not cheap because of the infrastructure and property costs involved.However, private equity had been pouring into the establishment of independent schools space, which accounted, in part, for the increase in the number of these schools, he said.Funding sources such as the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) and Old Mutual had also boosted the number of schools.Six years ago, Old Mutual and the PIC established the Schools and Education Investment Impact Fund of South Africa to address infrastructure backlogs and support the improvement of education.Nolwandle Mthombeni, an equity analyst at Mergence Investment Managers, said there was definitely room for more players and South Africa would continue to have growth in the number of private schools. So far, the booming demand for private schooling has been met in the main by dominant players such as Curro Holdings, whose share value has increased more than 1,000% over the past five years, outperforming Capitec.Smaller players have, however, emerged on the scene and have found traction.One such entrant is Nova-Pioneer Education Group, which operates three schools in South Africa and two in Kenya.Speaking at Pioneer Academy Jackal Creek in Northriding, co-founder and CEO Chinezi Chijioke said that over the group's two years of operation locally, applications had roughly doubled each year.Establishing and maintaining the schools had not been easy, he said, adding that the biggest challenge of breaking into the market had been maintaining the focus of the group's vision for private education.</img>Des Hugo assists a pupil at Pioneer Academy Jackal Creek in Northriding, Johannesburg.
