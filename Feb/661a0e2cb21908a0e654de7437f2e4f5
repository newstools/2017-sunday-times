There was a time in the early '90s when the monkey graphic on the cover of Doolittle, the Pixies' second album, appeared at every house party and at every varsity digs in Cape Town. Take the party outdoors: cool summer concert series kicks off in JoburgDoolittle was the soundtrack for a first taste of freedom in a city far away from my parents - freedom to dance the night away, to stay out until dawn, freedom to play its bellowing tracks as loud as I wanted.Here Comes Your Man was an anthem at the alternative rock joint, The Fringe. It was played almost as often as Norman Greenbaum's one-hit wonder Spirit in the Sky, which sounded like insipid pop bubblegum compared with the raw energy and tortured soulfulness of Black Francis's vocals.Sometimes the DJ would spin the two big Pixies hits, Here Comes Your Man and Where is My Mind (from their debut album Surfer Rosa) as a double whammy. Then, Francis's screeching voice, backed by lead guitarist Joey Santiago, then bassist Kim Deal and drummer Dave Lovering, would have the crowd bouncing on the wooden floorboards until we were dripping with sweat.In quieter moments, Deal would get inside your head with Gigantic - A Big Big Love. Her sugary vocals were a respite of softness when your neck was sore from moshing to the other tracks.Then Francis and Deal got into a fight and I moved on to Radiohead and forgot about the disbanded punky-rocky phenomenon for a while.WATCH the music video for The Pixies' Here Comes Your Man PixiesA few years later I saw Francis in concert at Madison Square Gardens, New York, with David Bowie - for Bowie's 50th birthday concert - and remembered how groundbreaking he'd been. There was nothing like the Pixies - and there hasn't been anything like them since. They will always sound like freedom. The Pixies will headline the inaugural Rock on the Lawns festival on March 18 at Carnival City, Joburg. Tickets at computicket.
