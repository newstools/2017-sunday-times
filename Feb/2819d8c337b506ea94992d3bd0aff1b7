Italtile, a retailer and franchiser of local and imported tiles, sanitaryware, bathware, laminated flooring and other home-finishing products managed to buck the overall weak trend in the retail sector as more homeowners renovated instead of buying new properties. The group owns store brands Italtile, CTM and TopT.CEO Jan Potgieter, who has been at the helm for about two months, said on Friday: "What we see is that new build is very slow." An expected improvement in the situation had not happened.This, he said, was partly because of a slowdown in the top end of the market - not "necessarily because people can't afford it ... it's more of a wait-and-see game because of uncertainties and alternate investments."They [consumers] haven't spent as much as we would have liked to see."TopT, which caters for lower-end consumers, was the star performer for the six months. "That profile of customer is a little bit more resilient because a house is an important asset for them and they keep on investing in it," he said.The TopT brand had identified a gap in the market, which was partly accountable for the good performance of the group, Potgieter said."We will continue with our growth plans on TopT. When we talk about CTM, that's probably where we've seen the biggest challenges from a consumer point of view."During the period, 11 new stores were opened across all the company's brands.In the next financial year it expected to open four new CTM outlets in South Africa and possibly another two elsewhere in Africa, Potgieter said.The company has 156 stores across all of its retail brands, with 16 elsewhere in Africa.Locally manufactured products make up 70%-80% of the merchandise at TopT stores, as well as CTM stores, which cater for lower- to middle-income consumers.At the group's upmarket brand, Italtile, about 90% of the products sold are imported, which has hindered the group's overall performance as consumers targeted by this brand have been reluctant to spend.John Loos, a household and property sector strategist at FNB, said data showed that for the first three quarters of last year the square meterage of addition and alteration to homes had risen, showing year-on-year growth of about 20%.Even though it had become expensive to upgrade homes, "the percentage of people who are selling more than upgrading has diminished substantially, so they have to upgrade", said Loos.Previously, there had been more of a tendency for people to move to better houses at better market prices, but now consumers were staying put and renovating. The strong growth in the home-improvement sector would settle down, Loos said, but if the economy continued to amble along it was conceivable that the levels now being experienced could be sustained for a few years."You might find that the current levels may be sustained, but if they are looking for growth, retailers are probably going to struggle to find that in the coming years," said Loos.Potgieter admitted "it's a tough environment out there, [but] we believe that the strength of our business model is an advantage"."We generate a lot of cash and we've got a supply chain that's integrated," he said.Damon Buss, an equity analyst at Electus Fund Managers, said: "Italtile has benefited from the lower end of the market segment where people will buy stuff and redo their house, so they can rent out rooms. This especially has helped the TopT brand which services these consumers."Discounting in the retail sector was a big feature."There's more downtrading rather than looking for discounts. Rather than going into an Italtile store, they go to a CTM store."Buss said this was why Italtile Group had done well: by offering consumers good, better and best through its three brands.System-wide turnover, which excluded sales from the group's supply chain businesses and corporate stores, had for the six months to December risen 14% to R3.5-billion and profit for the period 15% to R494-million.Like-on-like retail store revenue rose 8.8%, and average selling price inflation was 7.6%.But when it came to offshore expansion, said Potgieter, "there is enough opportunity within South Africa where we want to explore. But long term, there is nothing preventing us trying and looking at other opportunities."tshandup@sundaytimes.co.za
