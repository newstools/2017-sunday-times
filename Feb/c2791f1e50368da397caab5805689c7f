When did you start IntsasaFoods, and what was the inspiration behind it?We started IntsasaFoods in June of last year. Our inspiration came from our own experience as young professionals not being able to find affordable, tasty and healthy ready-made meals delivered to our door.We all have a love for food and were disappointed by the lack of variety, serving size and flavour of what was available in the shops. This drove us to create a menu with the food we wanted to eat.Who owns the company?There are three of us who own the company and we re all friends who met while at Rhodes University. I previously ran a catering company called Purple Chefs in Grahamstown, which is where I met other co-owners Jonathan Bell and Kabelo Matlala.Having healthy ready meals delivered to your door is now a realityDo you think the LCHF trend is here to stay?The LCHF is not a fad or a trend. This is not a diet but a lifestyle change that is helping many people manage their weight loss and live healthier lives.If you look at a group like Banting for Beginners on Facebook, it has a following of over 70,000 people. However, we re determined to provide customers with healthy tasty food. So if our customers are requesting other options, we will change our menu to support this demand.What are your best-selling meals?Our Beef and Chicken Trinchado with sweet potato mash is a big hit with our customers. We also get rave reviews for our vegetarian meals.How do you keep your prices so affordable?We have great relationships with our suppliers and we re also always looking for innovative ways to cut costs that don t impact the quality of service and food. One of our goals is to cook food that we ourselves can always afford. This article was originally published in one of the Sunday Times Neighbourhood: Property and Lifestyle guides.
