Mbete left parliament on Thursday evening for the Bay Hotel where she hosted the Speaker's Ball for family, friends and comrades."All of you people deserve to find a good partner to enjoy the rest of your life with," was her message.A few hours before the ball, Mbete faced an unprecedented tongue-lashing from EFF leader Julius Malema.Mbete ordered Malema and EFF MPs to leave the assembly, which led to Malema accusing her of protecting President Jacob Zuma - "a man who violated the constitution".Very soon Malema's rant against Mbete turned from parliament to party politics."He [Zuma] used you, he dumped you, he used you and promised you that you are going to be a president. You went home, you slaughtered a cow and he dumped you," said Malema. Nice speech, too bad No1 didn't understand itMbete responded that she would not be abused by Malema.When the glitzy ball eventually began just before midnight, Mbete did not want to discuss what had happened in parliament."Tonight all I wanted was to forget everything and enjoy this with you and be with you," she told her guests.Guests included ministers Lindiwe Zulu, Nathi Mthethwa and Siyabonga Cwele as well as Telkom chairman Jabu Mabuza.Mbete wore an elegant grey silver dress for the opening of parliament and the ball.Her husband, Mokgatla Khomo, whom Mbete referred to as the "comrade sitting next to me", also welcomed guests. The guests drank champagne on the terrace of the Bay Hotel in Camps Bay before being entertained by a traditional performance in the hotel lobby.Guests were ushered into the decorated ballroom which had pictures of Mbete on screens.Comedian Celeste Ntuli was the master of ceremonies and made only one political joke when she called for "order", mimicking Mbete from earlier that night.A jazz band played while guests dined on line fish and berry compote as starters.Guest could choose between beef or chicken as the main dish. Dessert options included koeksisters, cheesecake and meringues.The event continued well into the early hours of Friday.
