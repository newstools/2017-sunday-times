Beetroot's brilliant ruby roots have long been prized for their positive effect on the liver as they assist the body's natural detoxification processes. They are packed with essential nutrients and all-important fibre, and have been shown to be beneficial for heart health and in reducing inflammation. They boast excellent amounts of vitamin C, potassium, iron, manganese, and a range of protective antioxidants. Beetroot bread salad 'cake'1) Don't toss away the greensBeetroot greens are even more nutritionally dense than the fleshy roots. Add tender leaves to salads for a vibrant burst of colour, and steam, sweat or stir-fry larger leaves in any dish where you would normally use Swiss chard or spinach. Cook up the tasty greens on the day of purchase and store trimmed roots in the fridge for two to four weeks.2) Go rawIf childhood memories of cooked beetroot swimming in vinegar put you off, it is time to try them raw. Grate or slice beets into salads, or serve them finely diced as soup sprinkles that pack a refreshing crunch. Raw beets aren't nearly as sweet, and their earthy flavour is sublime.3) Cook themBeetroots are the main ingredient in Russian borscht soup, but they make a welcome addition to any stew. Their sweetness will soften the acidity in tomatoes without the need for sugar, and they are equally tasty nestled among your favourite roasted veggies, where they will add a cheery blush to the mix.Follow the author of this article, cookery teacher Daniel Jardim, on facebook.
