Dean Furman's goal in the 21st minute of the first half helped United leapfrog title contenders Bidvest Wits, Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns, who were all above them when they kicked off against poor Highlands Park in Tembisa on the East Rand last night.Highlands head coach Gordon Igesund looked a very disappointed man after dropping points, yet again, leaving his team second from the bottom.Highlands were the first side to threaten goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse but he denied the hosts in the 18th minute when the former Chiefs man moved out of his line to thwart an attempt by Peter Shalulile.Minutes later, Highlands wasted a perfect chance when Shalulile turned provider to striker Carlton Mashumba, who made a mess of a clear-cut goal opportunity.Highlands were punishedwhen the hard-running Furman slotted the ball past goalkeeper Tapuwa Kapini after the former dispossessed defender Kgomotso Koena to register his first goal of the season.By then, frustration began to creep into the Highlands camp as veteran shot-stopper Kapini started an unfriendly exchange of words with Igesund, who shouted at him for wasting time before taking his goal kicks.Highlands Park (0)-0SuperSport United (1)-1- TMG Digital
