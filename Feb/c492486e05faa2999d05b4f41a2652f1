That is the aim of the Sunday Times Top 100 Companies Leaders on the Move mentorship initiative, sponsored by Johnnie Walker*, a brand that inspires personal progress and recognises that the journey is as important as the destination.On the day of the next event Friday February 17 a small, selected group of budding entrepreneurs will once again travel on a luxury coach around Johannesburg, hosted by well-known broadcasting personality Jeremy Maggs.Along the way, they will spend one power-packed hour at a time with carefully chosen business leaders who will share their business philosophy; the highs and low of their business careers; lessons learnt on the way; and how they ve overcome adversity. This will be followed by a delicious lunch enjoyed with some of Johnnie Walker s exclusive whiskies.At the last Leaders on the Move for 2016, Sandra Griffiths, marketing and innovation director at Diageo SA, which owns the Johnnie Walker brand in South Africa, said the journey to the pinnacle of leadership was often not smooth, requiring tomorrow s leaders to be adept at overcoming adversity.They also need to believe in themselves and their vision, particularly if they re planning an entrepreneurial venture.At last year s event, in October, Maggs spoke to Outsurance CEO Willem Roos, Liberty Holdings group CEO Thabo Dloti and Growthpoint Properties CEO Norbert Sasse.Confirmed for the February 2017 event are Nando s Southern Africa CEO Geoff Whyte; Nkonki co-founder Sindiswa Zilwa; and Alessandro Khojane, the founder of Italian restaurant Gemelli Cucina Bar.How to win a seatWant to board the bus?
