She spends a week at the school every second year giving advice and input.Anthony Roberts managing director of the academy says they would be delighted if Leith were made a judge on the show. What we would really love is for her to be a guest judge on the OSUth African version that would be great exposure for us he joked.Roberts believes she would be a great Bake Off judge. She is so disarming. She keeps things casual its her style to put everyone at their ease. On her biannual visits here the students know that she is coming but not the actual day. She will just pop up at their side in the kitchen. He says that what you see on TV is what you get. Prue is tough but fair. All her criticism is constructive. She tends to be the voice of reason. Having cooked for so many years she understand the difficulties faced in the kitchen. But she doesn t suffer fools gladly. For a technical and flavour point of view no contestant will catch her out. - TMG Digital/The Times
