Sex Talk: What's the best choice for long-acting birth control?It's the first time such technology has been classified as effective in preventing pregnancy and is a breakthrough that could spell the end for hormonal and intrusive birth control measures.There's no question that the pill liberated women.

It then tells you whether or not you could get pregnant on that day.Natural Cycles is easy to use: you take your temperature each morning and log it in the app. The science is simple: post-ovulation, progesterone warms our bodies by up to 0.45 C.
