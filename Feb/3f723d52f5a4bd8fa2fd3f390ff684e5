Israel's government has approved about 6,000 new settlement homes since Trump took office last month and the White House raised no objections, giving hope to the Israeli right that Trump was on its side. But Trump said that while he did not believe "the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace", building new settlements "may not be helpful".Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the UN, played down Trump's statement, saying that it did not signal any change in policy.The Trump warning came after Netanyahu said he would establish the first new West Bank settlement "as soon as possible".Netanyahu has been under pressure from right-wing parties in his coalition to build more settlements since Trump took office.But he is a less enthusiastic settlement builder than some of his ministers and has opposed attempts to formally annex parts of the West Bank .
