Well a Turkish engineering firm, Letrons, has gone and built a transformable BMW that s not only 100% foldable but also drivable too. Okay so maybe not in the traditional sense you can only drive it around using a remote control. Still, it s a pretty impressive feat nonetheless. The team apparently spent eight months building the prototype you see here. Want one? Well apparently you can order one just expect to cough-up a fair amount of dough for the privilege.WATCH: See Letron's BMW Transformer in action This article was originally published on IgnitionLIVE, South Africa's premier motoring title which delivers supercharged motoring content.
