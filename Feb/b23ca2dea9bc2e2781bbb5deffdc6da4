Joburg and Cape Town come to life on the first Thursday of every month, when art galleries and cultural attractions across town open till late giving you a chance to explore a different side to your city. First Thursdays is your chance to indulge your senses after a day of work; see the art, taste the food and hear the music on an epic night of exploring.For more information, check out first-thursdays.co.za.Feed off the artsy ambiance with vibrant prints and blocks of colour. We suggest pairing local art with local fashion, so opt for separates from your favourite SA designers. First Thursdays is a festive but casual occasion, so keep it cool with relaxed, flowing silhouettes. If you re coming from work, swap your shirt for something with a pop of colour or an artsy print; a graphic tee and sneakers are a great way to tone down sharp tailoring.
