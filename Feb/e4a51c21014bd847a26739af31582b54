Those with taxable income of R1.5 million per year will in future cough up 45% of their income to the state.Gordhan said although global economic growth is slightly better than the preceding year at 3.4% geo-political and economic uncertainties have increased.South African growth is estimated to reach only 1.3% this year which the finance minister admitted provides a major challenge to government and citizens."We need to radically transform our economy so that we can have a more diversified economy with more jobs and inclusivity in ownership and participation " said Gordhan. He signalled government's intent on land reform by earmarking R30 billion for it between now and 2019."Our financial situation is difficult but we still produced a credible budget " Gordhan claimed.He said South Africa needed to prioritise its spending better and had to build the widest possible partnership to promote consensus and action on a programme for inclusive growth and transformation.-TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
