The Guards' Sepahnews website said the manoeuvres in the northeastern province of Semnan were aimed at demonstrating their "complete preparedness to deal with the threats" and "humiliating sanctions" from Washington over last weekend's test launch."Different types of domestically produced radar and missile systems, command and control centres, and cyber warfare systems will be used in this exercise," it said.A list of the missiles to be deployed published later on the website showed they were of very short range - up to 75km.US President Donald Trump imposed new sanctions on Iran on Friday over its test launch of a medium-range missile.Hours later, US Defence Secretary James Mattis said that Iran was "the single biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world".The sanctions do not yet mean that the US has abandoned its commitments to lift measures aimed at Iran's nuclear programme, officials said, but Trump has made no secret of his contempt for the accord.
