The bank settled with the Competition Commission and it filed the settlement with Competition Tribunal on Monday. This settlement was done to encourage speedy settlement and full disclosure to strengthen the evidence for prosecution of the other banks said the Commissioner Tembinkosi Bonakele.The Commission found that from at least 2007 Citibank N.A. and its competitors had a general agreement to collude on prices for bids for the spot trades in relation to currency trading involving US Dollar / Rand currency pair.It found that Citibank and its competitors manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times.Citibank will pay an administrative penalty of R69 500 860.This figure does not exceed 10% of Citibank s annual turnover in South Africa the commission said."Citibank N.A. undertook to cooperate with the Commission and avail witnesses to assist the prosecution of the other banks that colluded in this matter."Last week the Competition Commission referred a collusion case to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution against Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited BNP Paribas JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A Investec Ltd Standard New York Securities Inc. HSBC Bank Plc Standard Chartered Bank Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd Commerzbank AG; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited Nomura International Plc. Macquarie Bank Limited Citibank N.A. ABSA Bank Limited (ABSA) Barclays Capital Inc and Barclays Bank plc.It has asked the banks be found in breach of competition act and be faced with a fine of ten percent of their annual turnover.Absa Bank is also not facing a fine because it co-operated with the commission and is believed to have blown the whistle on corrupt trades and provided evidence of traders chatting in chat rooms about fixing a price for certain trades.Some lawyers believe the tribunal will have a tough case proving the case as the trades took place offshore and the Competition Act only gives authorities jurisdiction over South Africa.
