With the pap lasagne - people love the mash-up of two recipes from different countries to make an amazing creation. When it comes to vetkoek - you can t lose with a South African classic... I mean who doesn t love vetkoek? She believes her fuss-free pastry is a tart game changer - no rolling out no blind baking it takes the fiddle and fuss out of baking.
