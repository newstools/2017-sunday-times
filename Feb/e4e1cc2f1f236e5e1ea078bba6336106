"They change depending on the light and how they're hung and that affects how people view them."The artist, who lives across from the Cape Point nature reserve, says she's drawn to the sculptural form of the flowers."Botanists ask if I know the history and heritage of the plants, but I'm literally only drawn to the shapes and colours of the flowers."This strikingly modern Western Cape home embraces its country views at every turnThe drops, tears of resin, that are moulded and polished so they reflect the light are strung in groups of three, four, or even up to 40 to become installations that are garnering the attention of art collectors and interior decorators."People are drawn to them for different reasons," says Daya. "I am too. I collect the flowers on my walks and they're always different due to the seasons and the type of plants they are. They may be accessible as an art work, but they're definitely unique."Heller usually works on much bigger forms, creating large sculptures of the human form that have been exhibited at Burning Man and Grande Provence in Franschhoek."The drops do carry an ironic symbolism for me. They're preserved in the resin which is symbolic of water, which should be fluid and free, but it's not - except when the light plays with it," she says."The flower is a celebration of the plant, it's the sexual organ of the plant, but it's not alive any more and it can't grow anymore, even though it's a symbol of life.""They're gorgeous, pretty things," says Trent Read of Knysna Fine Art."They remind me of being a child and being enchanted by dew on plants in the morning. For me it's like she's wrapped the flowers in a dewdrop and that's quite magical."
