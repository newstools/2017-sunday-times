Pep Guardiola's side were irresistible going forward and an open door at the back as they secured a 5-3 first-leg win in the last 16, the highest-scoring match at this stage of the tournament's 25-year history.City's performance still leaves them with questions to answer when they confront this gifted Monaco side in the second leg on March 15 - but one fact remains without dispute in this Guardiola-era - City cannot live without Sergio Aguero.Leroy Sane was the standout performer in one of the finest matches seen at the Etihad - but the cutting edge was provided by the 28-year-old Argentine Aguero, whose future has come under scrutiny in recent weeks.The spectacular and instant impact of Brazilian teenager Gabriel Jesus saw Aguero left on the bench for the Premier League victories against West Ham United, Swansea City and Bournemouth.However, it is on nights like this, against AS Monaco, where Aguero demonstrated that the idea City would somehow be better off without him is nonsense. Wayne Rooney says he's not going anywhere Jesus, at just 19, and 21-year-old Sane, represent a golden future for The Citizens along with Raheem Sterling at 22, but Aguero looks like a player in his prime and fit to play his part, not just now but in the years ahead.He has no point to prove, his record speaks eloquently enough, but he has accumulated a reputation and body of work that makes the finest defenders fear his threat. And at the elite level of the Champions League, that is a priceless commodity.Against the Ligue 1 giants, it was a match that was arguably the most enthralling seen at the Etihad since Aguero's 94th-minute winner in May 2012 which secured City their first title in 44 years. And the striker showed he still retains all the old powers.He and his City colleagues had to contend with a blaze of attacking intent from Monaco, but in between the youthful zest of Sane and Sterling, he was the spearhead and creator.The Argentinian marksman was rewarded for trying his luck with his first goal that prompted a dreadful error from Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic. He scored his second with a crisp, instinctive right-foot volley and then set up the fifth for Sane, the goal that gave City a cushion. It was the complete, consummate attacking performance.Aguero also has a psychological impact on opponents and it gives Guardiola and City a powerful weapon. His first goal was City's 200th in the Champions League and he has now scored five in his past three matches at the Etihad Stadium in this competition.Yes, his recent scoring form has not been of his usual standard but he is the epitome of the phrase "class is permanent".The Catalan's decision to shunt popular goalkeeper Joe Hart out to Torino in Italy on loan was taken on the chin by supporters who idolised him. Any similar fate for Aguero would not meet such easy acceptance.Guardiola's embrace and kiss on Aguero's forehead when he left the action late on Tuesday evening was surely a gesture of appreciation that should end the speculation - although this latest masterclass must have done that anyway.
