The government is ready to consider the kind of legislative "interference" in the FA's affairs usually forbidden by Fifa - unless English football's governing body met an April deadline to begin to modernise.That could lead to a ban for the FA that would prevent England playing international fixtures and stop Premier League teams from taking part in the Champions League and Europa League. Helping hands for Gunners seal itFifa's rules do not specify what constitutes government interference in its member associations, but Article 19 of its statutes states: "Each member association shall manage their affairs independently and without undue influence from third parties."Article 14 adds: "Violations may also lead to sanctions, even if the third-party influence was not the fault of the member association concerned."Those sanctions extend to club and national team matches, a fate that could befall the FA in the wake of Thursday's parliamentary vote of no confidence in the FA.In the debate, sports minister Tracey Crouch adopted her most hardline stance on its repeated failure to transform a governance structure in which only eight of its 122-strong council are women and four are from ethnic minorities, with a single board member representing both groups.Having previously promised to strip the FA of 30-million of public money and threatened to block future bids for World Cups, Euros and Champions League finals if the status quo persisted, Crouch warned the government would consider further "legislative, regulatory and financial options to bring about this change needed".- The Daily Telegraph
