For anyone living in Accra, as Clottey does, this might seem an absurd question because the yellow plastic containers from which Clottey's works have been made for almost a decade are a common sight in Ghana.They are known as Kufuor gallons in ironic homage to the second president of the country, John Kufuor , whose tenure was infamous for water shortages.Gallery hopping: catch the creative wave that's sweeping through SA's art world The containers in a journey typical of the post-independence economic relations between Africa and Europe not lost on Clottey originally carried cooking oil from Europe to Ghana and were then repurposed for the transportation of water and petrol.Clottey started using the gallons about 15 years ago, finding in them "a canvas where I could express myself artistically; I'd put them together and I'd paint on them and move them around, like a puzzle. At that time I couldn't sell my work, but I still wanted to create art, and gallons were widely available."Clottey coined the term "Afrogallonism" in relation to his use of the containers - a description not only of their material form but also more broadly of an artistic movement arising out of the symbolism of the gallons as "bringing up issues of water and environment [and the] impact of consumerism on the African landscape..."Using materials that are commonly in circulation also means that there is a relevance to an audience who may not be interested in art, which in turn will hopefully encourage creativity in younger generations. This is what Afrogallonism ultimately stands for - it is the new Africa, the future of Africa."New identities vs old traditionsThe future of Africa and its art and artists is the focus of fair curator Tumelo Mosaka's Tomorrows/Today section at this month's Cape Town Art Fair; it is as one of the 10 featured artists that Clottey will be exhibiting for the second time in South Africa.Clottey is deeply interested in Ghana's history and its successes and failures in the 60 years since it became the first African country to shake off colonial rule .On Ghana's Independence Day last year he and the members of GoLoKal, the performance collective he founded, staged My Mother's Wardrobe at Gallery 157 in Accra. They dressed in the clothes of their dead mothers in order to highlight clashes between gender identities and tradition in Ghanaian funeral practices.When Clottey's mother died, her belongings were supposed to be locked away for a year and then distributed among the female members of her family. Tradition dictated that, as her son, Clottey would not inherit her belongings. He considered this an unjust removal of the last vestiges of his relationship with his mother, so he decided to wear her dresses and carry her bags through the streets of Accra. The effects of colonialism and globalisation are skewing our traditions towards the Western world. In the name of modernity, we are losing our traditions This kind of intervention is in keeping with Clottey's belief that "our struggles in Accra, and many across Africa, are based on our miscommunication with traditional culture".But he's also concerned that "the effects of colonialism and globalisation are skewing our traditions towards the Western world. In the name of modernity, we are losing our traditions."While he's had shows in the UK, Europe, the US and China, Clottey is careful not to give too much credence to the idea of the success of African artists relying on recognition by what some may see as the "mainstream art world".He says "the idea of there being a mainstream art world has to change"."There are cultural centres all across the globe and these exist in parallel to and in conversation with the larger art markets. Certainly there are times when market focus is shifted onto a different geographical location, but what needs to be established is that popularity should [not] deny the histories of those places before [they receive] global attention.Cape Town exhibition challenges the way gender norms have shaped the creation of art"It can be helpful when local markets are given the economic means to grow, and if this results in younger generations becoming engaged and being able to provide a living from creating then I see that as a good thing."International recognition has resulted in more attention for Clottey's work in Ghana, which has allowed him "to start my own art workshop in Ghana so that my work inspires more artists to do the same and see that conceptual work can still flourish in Ghana".It was once jokingly said that Ghana was an acronym of "God Had Appointed Nkrumah Already", but the name of the country actually comes from the Soninke word for "warrior king", and it seems apt to think of Clottey as a kind of artist warrior king striving through his work to critique his country and get people talking.For him the most satisfying relationship between what he does and how it's received is for his fellow Ghanaians to realise that he's "not just doing this for myself. I'm doing it for the whole country." Clottey will be exhibiting at the Cape Town Art Fair at the Cape Town International Convention Centre from February 17 to 19.
