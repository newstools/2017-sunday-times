And the trauma, like a zip breaking before the model walks the ramp."We want to give the audience the rawness of young talent and also show how silk changes from being raw to becoming a soft fabric," Ledimo says.Even though South Africa's textile industry is still very small, he believes the show will open doors for the young designers and attract investors.WATCH the trailer for Raw Silk Ledimo started his menswear design career 17 years ago in his hometown of Bloemfontein."When I came up with the show, I thought about myself and how no one opened doors for me when I first moved to Johannesburg. The contestants will gain knowledge from the best in the industry, while also being taught about the business of fashion," he says.Ledimo says that in looking for the two other judges, he wanted people with flawless cred in the industry.Mashishi, for example, has provided makeup magic for celebrities like Bonang Matheba, Somizi Mhlongo, Pearl Thusi and Khanyi Dhlomo.He says that having worked behind the scenes with celebrities and on TV shows he's aware of the work that goes into putting a show together."I've been making stars all my life and being part of Raw Silk will showcase what I've learnt in the fashion industry and what I'm capable off," Mashishi says. He advises audiences to expect the unvarnished truth. "We speak vernacular because some of the garments can only be described in street language."Raw Silk also has educational value, he says. "We aim to inspire young people who are in the rural areas and have no clue how to tackle their fashion talent."Furmie adds: "The young designers are selected from all nine provinces and that is something that viewers nationwide will relate to. The show will also speak to aspiring designers who have questions about the industry and have no one to ask." Catch 'Raw Silk' on Tuesdays at 9pm on SABC1.
