But there was nothing fatherly about President Jacob Zuma as he giggled while a group of opposition MPs were being assaulted and chased out of parliament on Thursday night. He further made light of the whole debacle by exclaiming "finally!" and laughing some more when he finally got a chance to read his speech.Only a head of state with no sense of shame would enjoy seeing opposition MPs being roughed up every time he addresses parliament.
