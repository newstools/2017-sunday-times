The series called Ingozi aims to raise public awareness about road safety. I have no doubt that road safety education that starts at an early age and that uses popular technology and media platforms should be one of the core focus areas in assisting us to turn the tide on road safety said Transport Minister Dipuo Peters in a statement. At the same time we have to realise that the world view and experiences of our young people are changing all the time. We now live in the era of social media. If our road safety messages are not sufficiently fresh and creative they will get lost in the clutter of competing ideas. The series is aimed at the youth who die in disproportionately higher numbers on the roads.Peters said in January that 1 714 people had died on the roads during the festive season a 5% increase from the previous year. The 13-part series will go on air from February 12 to May 7 on SABC 1.
