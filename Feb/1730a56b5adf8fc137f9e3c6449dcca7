A rise in salaries and wages can attract a higher tax rate if an increase in remuneration pushes an employee into a higher tax bracket - the tax rate applied to these brackets or salary ranges varies so that higher earners pay more tax than lower earners. The state has in previous years made adjustments to income tax brackets and included rebates for inflation to ensure that the purchasing power of this income does not diminish for taxpayers.But in recent years the Treasury has provided only partial relief for fiscal drag, so inflation and growth in earnings have pushed taxpayers into higher tax brackets.Because of this, it is expected to collect about R15-billion more in income tax in the year to March 2018, enough to cover more than half of the R28-billion budget deficit projected for2017-18 without having to increase tax rates.Mike Schussler, chief economist at Economists.co.za, argued this week that by not fully adjusting income tax brackets and rebates in recent years to account for inflation the state collected R100-billion more than it would have had a full adjustment been made."This has been the biggest tax-raising method since 2010 for government revenue." Between 2010 and 2016, if fully adjusted for inflation, the government would have collected only R304-billion. But it did not fully adjust for inflation and raked in R413-billion. "Sure, a few extra jobs were created and salaries adjusted for inflation were higher - but not by 26.4%," he said.Professor Raymond Parsons, an economist at the North-West University School of Business and Governance, said that given the wide fiscal gap the Treasury was expected to resort to measures including "below inflation or no adjustment for higher income tax brackets"."Failing to provide relief at all for fiscal drag in the forthcoming budget it is estimated could bring in about R15-billion."Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan did not raise the marginal personal income tax rate last year. But in 2015 his predecessor Nhlanhla Nene raised the marginal tax rate by 1%.Economists said Gordhan might have to raise personal income tax to make up an expected revenue shortfall.Schussler said without a major hike in tax rates Gordhan still increased tax income from individuals by not adjusting tax brackets for inflation. If "one allows inflation to increase and you capture ever more people in the tax net and the top bracket was not raised at all last year you get more income earners in the top bracket"."Say inflation is 6% and salary increases average 7%, then government only lifts tax brackets 3%." This resulted automatically in 4% real growth in personal income tax.Schussler said from 2007 to 2016 government revenue from personal income tax rose 157% while inflation rose 71%.At the same time, company tax grew more than two-fifths, while revenue from value added tax (VAT) gained 102%. "VAT would in a sense reflect nominal gross domestic product growth as it did not really change," he said.Parsons said the impact of not fully allowing for fiscal drag was perceived to affect wealthier South Africans rather than ordinary citizens. "That does not mean that it costs less or is necessarily fair, but the search for additional tax revenue is now relentless," he said.Unless the government could further cut its spending, or reprioritise, solutions now had to involve increasing the burden on taxpayers, and this included providing only partial relief for fiscal drag, he said.But Parsons warned that governments had to live within taxation limits that promoted the goals of national development.South Africa is considered to have one of the highest tax rates globally.Schussler said the government's national tax revenue was 26.4% as a percentage of GDP. But if local government and the provinces were included, those percentages increased to more than 28% of GDP. If other government revenues such as UIF, stamps, water and electricity profits from local government are included then total government revenue as a percentage of GDP is close to 33%.He said: "Add private individuals' medical insurance and pensions - then in effect South Africa has over 41% [tax and social security take - private and government], which means we are one of the top tax countries in a sense on this planet!"speckman@sundaytimes.co.za
