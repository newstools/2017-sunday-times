The students sent a letter to Gauteng premier David Makhura, former health MEC Qedani Mahlangu, Health Department Director-General Precious Matsoso and deputy director-general Terence Carter, on January 18 last year in which they warned the officials against moving psychiatric patients from Life Esidimeni's Waverley Care Centre in Germiston.At least 94 psychiatric patients died in the care of NGOs , and Mahlangu resigned.Matsoso said yesterday: "By the beginning of November 2015, Section 27 informed me of the situation by phone, saying they wanted to take Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi to court."I facilitated a meeting between the Gauteng health department, Section 27 and the South African Depression and Anxiety Group."By the end of December 2015, an agreement had been signed."Section 27 wanted to make it a court order, but Gauteng told me the situation was solved and, in good faith, I convinced Section 27 and Sadag not to go to court."I regret not insisting on a court order ... We did not foresee that Gauteng would act in such bad faith."A Gauteng government spokesman said: "We receive letters daily. They are referred to the correct people. The question is whether the premier was aware the health department was acting in a way that endangered people's lives ... He acted when he became aware."DA MP Wilmot James said it was breathtaking to discover that highly regarded officials had been warned in such detail, but that the tragedy had occurred nevertheless.James said it was clear Makhura was part of the cover-up. "The DA will act against him," James warned.
