But with a new contract offer on the table, what is the situation of their manager of almost 21 years?Wenger told a press briefing on Friday that he will definitely still be a manager next season, whether at Arsenal or "somewhere else".Wenger, 67, said he would make a decision in March or April on whether to extend his 20-year spell at Arsenal. He left open the possibility that he would walk away from the north London club and into another job. Will a new coach be able to save the team from what's been a disastrous season thus far?It is believed the club have begun actively working on the succession plan ahead of Wenger's increasingly likely departure this summer, but remain willing to give their longest-serving manager more time before a definitive decision is confirmed.Friends and many club insiders believe that Wenger is now minded to stand down at the end of the season but, amid the rawness of a crushing 5-1 Champions League defeat by Bayern, the Frenchman is being encouraged not to rush to any final decisions.There is no sense that he is ready to retire as a manager.Violence broke out inside Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena on Wednesday between Arsenal fans amid angry exchanges over Wenger's future.There is also renewed doubt over the future of Alexis S nchez, with Paris St-Germain favourites to sign the Chile striker amid his refusal to sign a new contract and visible frustration at Arsenal's form.Wenger has always said he would assess his own performance near the end of the season before coming to a final decision and, while he will fight on for now, the realisation that Arsenal are unlikely to win the Champions League or Premier League will shape his thinking.When he signed a three-year contract in 2014, the feeling was that Arsenal were again ready to seriously challenge for the biggest trophies and move beyond simply Champions League participation. With the second leg against Bayern next month, they are on course for a seventh straight exit at the last-16 stage of the Champions League. THE BIG READWenger is also sensitive to the mood of supporters and the division over his future. Witnesses to some of the clashes among Arsenal fans on Wednesday told The Daily Telegraph that the atmosphere between supporters was the worst they had known.Speaking before the match, he reiterated that his future would be determined much closer to the end of the season.Asked by German radio station ZDF when he would specifically decide, Wenger said: "March, April probably."Arsenal do expect Wenger to give them time to approach replacements but do not believe there is an immediate need for clarity. A succession plan has been worked upon - and a list of names that include Thomas Tuchel, Max Allegri, Eddie Howe and Leonardo Jardim have been under consideration - but none have been approached.Arsenal's next match is at Sutton United tomorrow night in the fifth round of the FA Cup.Wenger is expected to be without several leading players for that match, including S nchez - who has been given time off - and captain Laurent Koscielny, who is recovering from a thigh injury suffered in Munich.
