In a match of few thrills, the Waratahs fought back from 13-9 down at half time to take control of the second half through a try from Wallaby lock Will Skelton just after the interval.Skelton, trimmed down after an off-season stint with Saracens in England, barged over following a break from fullback Andrew Kellaway.Winger Reece Robinson kicked the Waratahs to victory with five out of six attempts as a stand-in for concussed sidelined Wallaby flyhalf Bernard Foley.The Force, whose place in next season's competition is under speculation in a possible reduction in the number of teams, fought hard in the wet conditions but made too many mistakes.Flyhalf Jonno Lance scored all of the Force's points from a converted try and three penalty goals.Scrumhalf Ryan Louwrens set up the try with an offload for Lance to break the defensive line to score.It was a dour spectacle with 24 penalties disrupting the momentum. Force hooker Tatafu Polota-Nau, who amassed more than 140 caps for Waratahs before switching to the Perth-based club this season, came off the bench in the 50th minute.
