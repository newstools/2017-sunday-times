The standoff over stoppages ordered by inspectors, who in some cases conduct weekly checks, has added to tension between the industry, which hopes to benefit from rising commodity prices, and the Department of Mineral Resources.Section 54 safety stoppages began in 2008, when about 200 miners died. South African mines are among the deepest and most dangerous in the world and have a chequered safety history.Before 1994, the industry reported about 500 fatalities annually. Last year, the Chamber of Mines reported 73 deaths, down from 77 in 2015. Flexibility needed to realise BEE dream"We have no issues with section 54s; the issue comes around proportionality and uniformity of application; that's where the regulator and the industry have to find common ground," AngloGold CEO Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said in an interview on the indaba's sidelines."We have had lots of instances where section 54s have been applied correctly and some where they haven't, so we have to get to a point where it's applied correctly."AngloGold's South African output has fallen by a quarter to about a million ounces over the past three years.Venkatakrishnan said that over a decade AngloGold had reduced fatalities by about 80%, although there was still a lot to be done.To some, like Sibanye Gold CEO Neal Froneman, the application of some safety stoppages by inspectors is bullying: "Right now we are bullied and we cannot continue to be bullied. We have to look after all stakeholders' interests."Last month, Sibanye, South Africa's biggest gold miner, served summons on the department and three of its inspectors for suspending production at two of its Kroondal operations.Froneman said he did not want to see the inspectors sequestrated - which would be the result if Sibanye's court action was successful - but rather to act within the law, the way that companies acted within the law."I suppose the next step is they need to respond, they need to say why they did that because they acknowledged that they made a mistake."Froneman believes there has been a focus on the Rustenburg area."It's one region where people do not act within the prescribed law and they are causing damage. We have consulted, and we have provided solutions, there's just no action, there's just continuing section 54s that are illegal," he said. Perfect time to reinvigorate the rich promise of miningThe department reiterated earlier comments about mining companies not complying with the law but using the courts to threaten government and stifle debate about mine health and safety issues.The third-quarter production figures of Royal Bafokeng Platinum, which mainly operates out of the region, showed a 9% loss of output due to four safety stoppages.Between July and September, when the stoppages took place, the mining house said there had been no fatalities.Froneman said: "Let's build on the good things we have done, but let's also make sure we have a sustainable industry, and right now the approach is not sustainable, it's acting outside the law."Sibanye has not been the only company to launch legal action against the department.Last year AngloGold took it to court and won after its Kopanang mine was unfairly suspended from production.Gold Fields CEO Nick Holland, who operates the only fully mechanised mine in South Africa, South Deep, said the company had also been affected by safety stoppages."Often we've imposed our own stoppages even before the department does if we are not happy with safety. Our view is, try to resolve any differences with engagement and discussion, and that's been quite successful for us."An analyst, who did not want to be named in line with company policy, said the department had a punitive approach, whereas mining houses had a reactionary approach when a proactive one was needed. He said the law was clear but its application was an issue, and the lack of trust between parties did not make things better.mtonganal@sundaytimes.co.za
