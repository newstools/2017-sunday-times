She says: "I've been living on a caye off the coast of Belize for three years. I've been sympathetically restoring it and due to unforeseen circumstances have decided to move back to UK."The Daily Mail reports that Reed, 40, has owned it since 2012, having bought it for 150,000 (about R2.5-million) with the help of inheritance money from her mother, Virginia.She went to Belize to mourn her mother's death and ended up discovering - and buying - the island, then named it after her mom."I spent a couple years trying to transform it. But in the end I realised it would need millions to really transform it," Reed said.UPDATE: Bidding has now closed on this item. Reed did not receive a single bid.
