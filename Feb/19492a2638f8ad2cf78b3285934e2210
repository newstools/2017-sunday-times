Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight D Eisenhower rounded out the top five of 43 presidents in US history.It was the third such survey released by the C-SPAN television network ahead of the Presidents' Day weekend."Once again the big three are Lincoln, Washington and FDR - as it should be. That Obama came in at No12 his first time out is quite impressive," said Douglas Brinkley, a history professor at Rice University, in a statement by C-SPAN.
