Root was wrongly given out in the final over of England's five-run defeat in the second T20 in Nagpur on Sunday night, a decision that would have been overturned on appeal.DRS has now been part of test match and one-day international cricket for almost eight years, but until last Sunday, when Root was given out LBW despite clearly edging the ball, there had been little previous clamour for DRS to be introduced in T20, from the England squad or indeed from anyone else.This is despite the fact that T20 is also the only format where the ICC does not insist on neutral umpires.
