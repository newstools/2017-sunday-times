It's an acronym with catchphrases to get both publicity.The CR7 campaign of the soccer superstar and Ramaphosa's CR17 campaign are "same same but different".In both, eager marketers and lobbyists have used the catchy brand to attract fans and supporters.But unlike Ronaldo, who will willingly strut around in his CR7 underwear, Ramaphosa cannot lay his ambitions bare.Jackson Mthembu backs Ramaphosa to be next ANC leader For now he is relying on a sophisticated and well-resourced campaign to get him elected ANC president.It has been rolled out despite a ban by the ANC on official campaigning.Under the banner of CR17 Siyavuma, a broad digital campaign has been launched alongside internal party lobbying in all provinces ahead of the ANC's December elective conference.Ramaphosa denies having anything to do with the campaign, or even knowledge of it.Ramaphosa's spokesman, Ronnie Mamoepa, said: "The deputy president bears no knowledge of the said campaign, nor has he given his authority nor approval for the campaign."The campaign sports a distinct "CR17 Siyavuma" logo across all digital marketing platforms and branding. The CR17 campaign logo stands for Ramaphosa's initials alongside the year of the elective conference and the words "We agree".A website has been set up with Ramaphosa's face on the front page and a countdown clock to the December conference.The formal site also punts the campaign's statement which is three Cs and three Rs: "Combat corruption, combat nepotism and combat tribalism" alongside "Restore ANC, reclaim ANC and reunite ANC".It has pictures of merchandise bearing the campaign logo and Ramaphosa's picture, which supporters can print.His lobbyists have used Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to push Ramaphosa's message and it has gained some traction.The campaign has been largely based on his anti-corruption stance.The accounts post pictures of Ramaphosa from various events, re-post articles which quote him and use graphics and memes which punt him.A source with knowledge of the campaign said it was important to "get the conversation going and to test the appetite for a Cyril Ramaphosa presidency. We are trying to get this social- media-ready and to do things differently to how things are done in the ANC. We are trying to gloss things up and create hype."</img>Cyril Ramaphosa s ANC presidential campaign gimmick about which the candidate claims to be ignorant. Image: Supplied Cyril Ramaphosa s ANC presidential campaign gimmick about which the candidate claims to be ignorant. Image: SuppliedHe did not want to be named because formal campaigning and lobbying are banned in the ANC.Ramaphosa's campaign had a late start, with his supporters and lobbyists only beginning their work in December when he confirmed that he would stand in the election for the next ANC president.The campaign of his main opponent, former AU Commission chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma,had a head start; her lobbyists have been campaigning in ANC structures for over a year.Ramaphosa's campaign, however, is leading the pack with its digital media strategy, followed by presidential hopefuls Zweli Mkhize, Jeff Radebe and Mathews Phosa, whose lobbyists have also turned to social media to garner support.However, many ANC traditionalists have argued that social media and positive media coverage did not translate into tangible support from the ANC branches.Political analyst Aubrey Matshiqi said using an elaborate social media and digital marketing campaign was a key characteristic in "American-style campaigning".He said there was a huge difference between US and South African politics."I am not persuaded that this campaign is in Cyril's interest."It may cause his campaign more harm ... Because you can have all mass appeal but if it is not aligned to ANC internal dynamics it means nothing," he said.hunterq@sundaytimes.co.za
