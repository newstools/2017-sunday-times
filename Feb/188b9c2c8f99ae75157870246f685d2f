Van der Westhuizen became the first South African to earn a Michelin star for his eatery - which is based in Nice in the south of France - when it received the award early last year.Speaking from Nice he said: "Since JAN received its first star in 2016 the pressure was clearly on and like in the movie Burnt our natural instinct was to fear every guest. That s how bad it gets. The psychological pressure is so intense that everything has to be perfect."The retention of the star becomes a mind occupation morning noon and night and after putting your head on the pillow it sometimes continues into dreamland " he laughed.Olive & rosemary sticks with whipped miso butterWhen asked if he now has his sights set on a second star Van der Westhuizen said: "I am not pushing myself or my team towards a second star but we are pushing ourselves to higher and better. This is just what we do."Van der Westhuizen admits that 2016 was not an easy year."The Nice attacks shocked and touched everyone in the Riviera and around the world and left the tourism industry in the South of France with a big dent that we are all trying to rebuild and make good again."For JAN - they are looking forward to a busy season which might include a few more South Africans joining the team in the kitchen. JAN currently boasts three South Africans working at the restaurant including Kevin Grobler Rutger Eysvogel and Scott Armstrong.Apart from making certain that he includes the best South African wines on his wine list he strives to re-invent South African dishes "that will appeal to a wider market and a more refined palate".Current winter dishes on his menu include an edible candle made with kaiings and pork lard and a dish called 'Mieliepap and Truffles' which plays on the humble maize ingredient paired with what he calls "the diamond of the kitchen".The Michelin Guide is published annually and is the oldest European restaurant guide which awards selected establishments with Michelin stars for excellence. Every year the guide sends unannounced inspectors - anything ranging from couples to a party of six who then anonymously report back to Michelin re-evaluating restaurants and making sure that what they serve is worthy of the star. However restaurants have to maintain very high standards in order for their Michelin star to be re-awarded annually.Van der Westhuizen is also the author of two cookbooks: A French Affair - which was released in 2013 and which went on to win the Gourmand World Cookbook Award in that year and JAN A Breath of French Air which was released last year to critical acclaim.
