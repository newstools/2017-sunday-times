Rosto is firmly becoming top of my favourite places to munch - it has the best chicken wings I have eaten, and chips that you cannot say no to. They are handcut and twice-fried. Twice-fried!The restaurant is in the now trendy neighbourhood of Linden, comfy and warm and friendly. The d cor is stylish; there is a central wood-burning oven; and a counter groans under the weight of irresistible spongey rectangles of freshly made focaccia. Mmmm, I only wish they'd serve it hot straight from the oven.Rosto eatery shows Joburg there's more to Italian food than pizzaRosto's owners are aiming for the Italian street food experience, but whatever you do, don't book a table expecting to be able to order pizza. There is none on the menu, although there are three pasta staples. The best of these is an exceptional lasagne loaded with mozzarella cheese. There's also a cannelloni and a parmigiano di melanze.But wood-fired, spit-roast chicken is Rosto's main focus. It comes roasted whole (R149), although you can order a half (R85) or a quarter (R45). The other option is chicken wings, starting at R32.50 for six, although that's never enough.The chicken is available in three versions: rosso, with chillies, garlic and sun-dried tomato; giallo, with Sorrento lemon and Mediterranean herbs; or verde, with parmesan and mountain herbs. We've tried them all - my partner loves the milder giallo, my favourite is the fiery rosso.Drinks include local gins, Italian craft beer and amazing "aperi teas" served with a double shot of spirits. Don't leave without trying the Nutella chocolate mousse, tiramisu, panna or semifreddo al torrone. All delicious, almost as nice as the owners - ever-present, friendly and willing to go the extra mile. Rosto, 69 7th Street, Linden, Johannesburg, 011-888-0369, eatrosto.com
