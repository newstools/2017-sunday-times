I am not sure when pairing became a thing.It was either during 2016, or in the Victorian era - although some gastronomic palaeontologists have explored the remains of cavemen to find they loved pairing venison with an aromatic glass of merlot.Either way: the good news is you don't have to be a wine connoisseur to let your taste buds off the leash for a hedonistic bout of detouring.Scenic Langeberg is well worth a visit for wine & olive lovers The Devon Valley Detour, in the heart of Stellenbosch wine country but off the well-worn track, is a five-stop day out that will see you washing the likes of nougat, ice-cream and boerewors down with all manner of reds, whites and ros s.Then again, our morning started off with hops rather than grapes .By 9am, we were at Stellenbrau Brewery for a tour and beer-tasting experience.Now I've always thought beer at this time of the day is only for lobster-red British tourists who take their omelettes straight up all over the globe with a draft in hand.As it turns out, one can have a perfectly sophisticated beer-tasting moment indulging in craft beer - which even included one that has zero percent carbs for the banters - after an informative tour of how the different beers are brewed.Next stop: Middelvlei.It is not often one eats on a wine farm without needing the French dictionary hidden up one's sleeve, but at Middelvlei, all you really need is a taste for boerekos and a strong stomach for moerkoffie.Here, the wine tasting was paired with boerebraai tapas (think biltong, cheese and tiny wors) and it was somewhat of a relief being offered a toasted cheese and tomato toebroodjie straight off the fire instead of a liver pat drizzled in sundried mandarins and oven-roasted French tree nuts (I made that up so don't try it at home).As if we weren't already stuffed to capacity with all things delicious, next up came Clos Malverne Wine Farm.I have to say that as a sweet-toothed monster, this was a major highlight for me. It is a prototype of heaven when five flavours of ice cream that include the likes of lavender and masala are paired up with delicious wines.Satiated, you ask? Absolutely.But now it was time for nougat and bubbles at The House of JC Le Roux.</img>Pairing sparkling wines with nougat at The House of JC Le Roux.

Image: @houseofjcleroux/InstagramAs at all other stops, a connoisseur carefully talked us through the details of what had been paired with what and why. There was much talk about how the (fill in the missing adjective) of each nougat complemented the (fill in the missing adjective) of each type of sparkling wine. My head was spinning by the end - I no longer knew my M thode Cap Classique from my pistachio-infused rose-flavoured. Sorry what were we talking about? I forget.Anyway, as if all this wasn't enough, the final stop was the pairing of SylvanVale wines with canap s at the Devon Valley Hotel, followed by a hearty supper.Luckily, we had also been booked in for the night.So, all that remained was a chance to lie around like boa constrictors digesting the equivalent of a 150kg man we'd swallowed along the way.And to tell our taste buds that from now on, the heady days of indulgence were over and it was back to the boundaries of crumbed chicken and a small salad with a glass of water at the homestead.
