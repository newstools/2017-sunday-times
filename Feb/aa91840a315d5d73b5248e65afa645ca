Civilians from other minority groups were significantly more likely than whites to have been shot while not posing a threat to other civilians or officers according to the latest research.The analysis was published online on Wednesday in a journal from Criminology and Public Policy and based on data compiled by The Washington Post. The lead author Dr Justin Nix from the University of Louisville said: Our findings are suggestive of an implicit bias minorities were significantly more likely to have been fatally shot. These results contradict a paper in July last year by economics professor Roland Fryer from Harvard University which found no evidence of racial bias in police shootings even though officers were more likely to interact physically with non-whites than whites .That study analysed thousands of incidents in 10 large police departments including California and Florida.Fryer concluded: On the most extreme use of force - officer-involved shootings - we find no racial differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken into account. His widely publicised findings were challenged by commentators including on the use of term racial bias rather than police shootings by race.A number of studies since 1950 have investigated racial bias in police shootings and suggested it is a problem.
