The governing body, Sanzaar, looks set to change the format of the competition again, after the latest incarnation of the ever-changing tournament was last year met with unfavourable reviews.Last year, the competition was increased to 18 teams but the organisers are having a rethink amid plummeting viewership. The convoluted competition structure hasn't helped.While SA Rugby will only adopt a position after this week's general council meeting, they may ultimately fall into line with the wishes of their alliance partners in Sanzaar.The South African team most vulnerable to the cull is the Southern Kings. Their poor results from last year apart, their financial woes could be the single biggest factor in their undoing.The Sunday Times understands taht local franchises need at leastR60-million a year to be remotely competitive in Super Rugby.There is similar uncertainty in Australia. The Force and the Rebels are struggling to balance their books, although the latter delivered some spirited performances last year.Last year's debutants the Jaguares of Argentina and the Sunwolves of Japan are unlikely to get the chop as their participation is an integral part of growing the game. World Rugby is sure to have their back.Ultimately, however, as one SA Rugby delegate put it, they will be guided by the findings of a report into the viability of the current structure as well as the views of the broadcasters.Meanwhile, a decision on the Springbok coaching structure is imminent.Beleaguered head coach Allister Coetzee is expected to retain his job, but it has been widely speculated that Franco Smith and Brendan Venter will be added to the set-up.Coetzee's position is expected to come under review following the June series against visiting France.
