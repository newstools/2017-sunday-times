Q. My wife and I are planning a trip from Cape Town to Scotland. We would like to stop off somewhere interesting in Europe on our way. We've been to Amsterdam and have no desire to go to Paris.My wife is wheelchair bound so the fewer connecting flights and schlepping around airports the better. Do you have any suggestions? - Dennis Waterhouse Ask Andrew: Wheelchair access in Italy & exploring Japan's spiritual sideA. From Cape Town, your direct flight options to Europe are fairly limited. Air France to Paris and KLM to Amsterdam are two of the direct routings on offer, along with British Airways to London and Lufthansa and SAA to Munich. If you fly via Joburg your options widen but you'd have two stopovers on all airlines as they will fly via their home airports or hubs.John Sage of Sage Traveling has visited over 90 European cities in his wheelchair conducting accessibility research and their website is full of information for you.He rates Berlin as the most wheelchair- friendly city in Europe, after London.The German capital is fairly flat with good pavements and ramps in the inner city.Many of Berlin's tourist highlights are all within walking distance of each other, making it easier for disabled people as well. The public transportation system is also generally accessible.A key factor in Europe is of course old cities, with either cobblestones or setts, but because Berlin was so heavily bombed during World War 2 there are far fewer of them here.Also, many hotels and museums are modern and designed to accommodate wheelchairs.To avoid the connecting flight on to the UK, you could consider taking a train from Berlin to London. European stations and trains cater well for wheelchairs.Barcelona in Spain is another city which Sage rates highly accessible. Do you have a query for our travel expert?
