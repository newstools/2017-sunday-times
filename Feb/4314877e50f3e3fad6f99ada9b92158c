"Please look after our kids. You will be safer now that I am gone. DBF [the Delangokubona Business Forum] threatened us. Love you," Mallon texted.Hours later, on November 23, his wife found him dead, allegedly after he killed himself, although the police are still investigating.The construction worker's death is linked to a mafia-style construction war in which the notorious forum has taken on the largest construction firms in South Africa - a situation that many believe has put civil works projects worth billions of rands, from pipelines to hospitals and from malls to roads in KwaZulu-Natal, at risk.Mallon's work at a KwaDukuza hospital, in Stanger, was hamstrung by Delangokubona in the months before his death.And this week a R1.8-billion revamp of Tsogo Sun's Suncoast Casino complex was halted by the forum, which is accused of using threats of violence, intimidation and extortion to get lucrative construction work.So severe is the threat that when he gives his state of the province address on Tuesday, KwaZulu-Natal premier Willies Mchunu is expected to outline plans to tackle organisations such as the DBF.Last year the eThekwini municipality took the forum to court. Former municipal boss Sibusiso Sithole called forum members "thugs" for holding up contractors at the electricity and refuse departments and preventing them from working.Also last year, construction firm Elias Mechanicos Building Civil Engineering went to court after its R120-million Durban city fleet building site was nearly torched - allegedly by the forum's members - early one morning in June.Two weeks ago the KwaDukuza district municipality was granted a temporary order preventing the forum from "threatening, intimidating, assaulting or interfering" with municipal employees, contractors or subcontractors at 34 construction sites.Days later, Deck, Steel &amp; Concrete CC won a permanent court order preventing the forum from obstructing work and intimidating staff at a site on the University of KwaZulu-Natal's Edgewood campus.</img>Construction worker Craig Mallon warned his wife of a construction mafia hours before his death.

When nothing came of that they started threatening contractors directly."He said some contractors, unwilling to suffer losses from site closures and penalty clauses, had kowtowed."We now have a situation where we have about 30 different forums, all with different aims and agendas, vying for work, training or payment."This attitude of entitlement has resulted in violence and threats. You have millions of people who want work and only a finite number of jobs available," Barnard said.
