If approved by the International Football Association Board's annual meeting at Wembley on March 3, the adoption of sin-bins, now commonplace in rugby, could ultimately come into professional football. But the IFAB made it clear there was no prospect of a sin-bin system in the elite level game any time soon."The AGM will consider the proposal to introduce temporary dismissals as part of modifications of the laws of the game; to be permitted in youth, veterans, disability and grassroots football only, not in senior or top level, international, professional football," said an IFAB statement.Rugby Union brought in a sin-bin system in 2001 whereby offending players must spend 10 minutes on the sidelines for a variety of offences.Another rugby-style change on the table is a ruling that only a team captain can talk to a referee in a bid to stop match officials being hounded by groups of angry players following contentious decisions.
