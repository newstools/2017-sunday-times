Lorenzo Gordinho's goal five minutes before the half-time break was enough to see Chiefs go two points clear of fellow title challengers Bidvest Wits and Cape Town City, although the Soweto giants have played three more matches than the former and one over the latter.The win takes Amakhosi's points tally to 33 and sees them claim the number one spot albeit on a temporary basis as Wits host new boys and bottom club Baroka FC on Wednesday.It wasn't overly convincing, but it was Chiefs' fifth victory on the trot, a run that would please head coach Steve Komphela, who has been constantly under pressure despite his team never really falling off the title chase. Wits inch a step closer to dreamIt took a set-piece to break the deadlock after a dull first half characterised by few and far in between goal-scoring opportunities.Winger Joseph Molangoane and left-back Tsepo Masilela had half chances to grab the lead. Masilela should have doubled the lead shortly before the break but the defender failed to hold on to the ball inside the opposition box after being set up by Molangoane while Franklin Cale had the best opportunity to get on the score sheet for the visitors.Chiefs' livewire Siphiwe Tshabalala delivered an inch-perfect corner aimed at Ramahlwe Mphahlele, who flicked the ball onto the path of Gordinho for the defender's fourth league goal of the season. He joins Tshabalala and Willard Katsande on the Chiefs top scorers list.The relegation-threatened Lions of the North should have equalised in the 66th minute when Khethukuthula Zwane's first-time drive forced keeper Itumeleng Khune into a great save.Highlands Park head coach Gordon Igesund has managed just a win in his 13 matches since taking over the reigns in October.Former Bafana Bafana coach Igesund's record now reads seven draws, five defeats and a win since taking over from Allan Freese.Highlands remain rooted in second spot from bottom with just 14 points from 18 matches.Igesund and his charges are yet to win a match this year following a 3-0 thrashing at the hands of high-riding Cape Town City in their first match of the year and a 1-1 draw at home to Polokwane City on Sunday.Chiefs will look to continue their winning run when they travel to Ajax Cape Town in their next league encounter on Saturday while Lions of the North will be at home to title contenders SuperSport United on the same day.
