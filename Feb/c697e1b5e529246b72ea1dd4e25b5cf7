Travelmole reports that a survey of 2,000 Brits on behalf of a travel insurance specialist found that half of skiers had been injured trying to film or photograph themselves on the slopes, with 28% requiring medical treatment as a result.Nearly three-quarters (72%) of these admit to filming or photographing themselves in action.Alpine skier Chemmy Crawford-Alcott, a four-time British Winter Olympian, joined in the chorus calling for common sense."The range of technological equipment you can take to the slopes now is incredible and it's fantastic but it's important to put your safety ahead of the selfie!"
