We put out a call to our readers to be part of the panel of tasters; they came together on a Saturday morning and were presented with coleslaw from three leading supermarkets - with no branding - on separate plates.Auditor Jade Craig was on hand to monitor the process from removing the packaging to numbering the products, overseeing the process in the kitchen and adding up the scores on the score sheets presented to the tasters. Judges' comments: There was a good balance of cabbage and carrots but mayonnaise was runny and not thick enough for a coleslaw, although it tasted fresh and the carrots were sweet. The panel enjoyed the creamy taste but some felt it lacked salt.Price: R41.50 Judges' comments: There was too much cabbage and insufficient carrot, making for a salad that was "too white". The tasters enjoyed the creamy taste but said there was too much mayonnaise and that the shredding of the cabbage was not even and there were some chunks.Price: R35.99 Judges' comments: Dry and bland with insufficient mayonnaise. The tasting panel did not enjoy the grated texture of the vegetables, saying it was too fine without any crunch. One taster said it looked like a pesto paste rather than a salad but the taste was fair. Packed with a handy fork.Price: R24.99
