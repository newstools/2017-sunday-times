Riaan Stassen upset the cosy club of South African banks with the invention of Capitec, a financial phenomenon born in the Winelands.He's now set his sights on South African wine and his Hidden Valley estate on the Helderberg could soon shake up things in the national cellar.Hidden Valley sounds like "hidden value", a banking Holy Grail, which this brand is.The last vintage from the old guard (Stassen took over in June 2015), Hidden Valley Sauvignon Blanc 2015 sets a high bar for successors.Hell man, this Chardonnay is absolutely heavenlyNow "hidden" and sauvignon blanc are something of a misnomer as this grassy green amalgam of asparagus and peas put New Zealand on the wine map a generation ago in the shape of Cloudy Bay.Easy to identify in a blind tasting and order in a restaurant, sauvignon blanc popped the pompous balloons of wine snobs.This one is a classical sauvignon, mixing tropical notes into the green bean and pea mix. Great with Thai food and Asian dim sum, it is chenin blanc for fashionable folk.The best news is that some supermarkets mistakenly believe that sauvignons are best in their vintage year. 2015 shows how mistaken these merchandising mavens can be as '15 knocks spots off '16.Johan Wegner at GetWine spotted a gap in the market and this deal a bottle of Hidden Valley Sauvignon Blanc 2015 for R59 per bottle is the upshot. An opportunity for opulent imbibing at a discount is something that neither a banker nor a punter can resist.Price per bottle: R59Where to buy?
