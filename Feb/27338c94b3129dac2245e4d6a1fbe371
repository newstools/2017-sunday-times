Twenty-one-year-old Akhil Suhas, from India, travelled 15,000km across New Zealand for a truly precious photo project, in which he dressed as the wizard Gandalf and shot self-portraits at various filming locations.9 films to spark your wanderlust - and 3 to keep you home foreverIn one of his breathtaking images, he is seen dwarfed by the famous Redwood forest on the North Island, with his wizard hat glimmering in the sun.In another, he scales the golden sands of Te Paki dunes, using his staff for support.According to the Daily Mail, Akhil spent six months working on the photo series. He used a self-timer to take the shots and often got up at the crack of dawn to score his epic sunrise shots.Other shots include him watching the blue-green waters of the Hokitika River, gazing over the alpine Lake Marian in the Fiordland National Park; and standing in the mist at Waiotapu, an active geothermal area on the North Island.Revealing his inspiration, Akhil, a graduate of the University of Auckland, said: "I was watching Lord of the Rings for the fifth time and then the idea struck."He said the trip had cost him quite a bit of money but added that he didn't care."I have my whole life ahead of me to earn money," he said. "At the end of the day, your memories last longer than material things."And that's a quote worthy of the wise Gandalf himself.
