More than 100 million households across the US and millions more worldwide will tune in for the biggest event of the American sporting calendar, which could see Brady become the most decorated quarterback in history.The 39-year-old superstar will become the first quarterback to win five Super Bowl crowns if he manages to guide the Patriots to victory over the Falcons before a crowd of 72,000 at Houston's NRG Stadium.A win would come 15 years after Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick's first triumph together in the National Football League showpiece, against the St Louis Rams in 2002. The final, surreal countdownIt would also represent a satisfying last laugh for Brady following his long-running battle with the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell.Brady was forced to miss the first four games of the season after losing a legal battle against the NFL over the 2015 Deflategate scandal, which saw the Patriots superstar accused of cheating by attempting to alter the pressure of balls to his advantage during a key championship game.It has led to the delicious prospect of Goodell having to possibly hand over the Vince Lombardi Trophy to Brady and his team-mates.Goodell for his part has attempted to damp down any possibility of an awkward trophy presentation by acknowledging Brady's remarkable career."Tom Brady is one of the all-time greats. He has been for several years," Goodell said."He's an extraordinary player, great performer, and a sure-fire Hall of Famer. So it would be an honour."Brady, too, has done his best to play down the popular narrative of revenge and redemption."I've moved on," Brady said this week."I focus on positive things in my life. I'm not worried about post-game or anything like that."Brady has instead been content to do most of his talking on the field.He averaged just under 300 passing yards a game in the regular season, and was magnificent in a comprehensive 36-17 demolition of the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship game two weeks ago.
