Now the singer and rapper has finally released his long-awaited debut album, The Chief and Classic Man is not on it, thankfully.At 14 tracks, The Chief could have been shorter, especially since many artists are going back to the early 2000s style of releasing 10-track albums.The opener is the mildly aggressive and vicious A Bull's Tale, where Jidenna raps like he's going hard. The Bull he's referring to is himself (he's a Taurus).DJs could turn the tables on rappers at the Metro FM AwardsHe might forever be clad in a three-piece suit, and it probably takes him hours to get his hair done, but he wants you to know that he could use his favourite accessory a cane to beat the crap out of you if he had to.He also goes hard (for Jidenna, anyway) on the track 2 Points, almost as though he knows people assume he's "soft" because of how he looks and dresses. On Long Live the Chief, he explains why he dresses the day he does: "They say 'Jidenna, why you dressing so classic?' I don't want my best-dressed day in a casket".Jidenna challenges genre on this album. He is as at home next to Wizkid as he could be next to PartyNextDoor and Drake.The best tracks on the album are Trampoline (which sounds like trap music made by Frank Sinatra) and Chief Don't Run (catchy, groovy and bassy). The spectacularly good Adaora, anchored by a flamenco guitar, could be the soundtrack to a sultry dance scene in a western starring Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas (yes, exactly like Desperado).The Afrobeat-lite hit A Little Bit More also stands out, as does Safari, where he compares a wild party scene to animals in the bush.Jidenna's clearly a super talented guy who can keep fans of different genres happy - just don't expect this to be life-changing, tectonic plate-shifting music.It's fun, it's a little thought-provoking in places and the melodies are dope.
