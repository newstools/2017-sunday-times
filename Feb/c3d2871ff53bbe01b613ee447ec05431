Scotland shock IrelandScotland hung on to upset Ireland 27-22 in a pulsating match at Murrayfield and secure their first opening day win in the Six Nations for over a decade.Two late penalties from captain Greig Laidlaw snatched a victory for the Scots that was founded on a dazzling first-half display which pushed the hosts into a 21-8 lead at the break.Fullback Stuart Hogg, the player of last year's tournament, scored Scotland's first two tries and centre Alex Dunbar dotted down for an unconventional third in a set move from a lineout. Boks to win by 20 points against Scotland, says Wallabies great CampeseIreland winger Keith Earls crossed for Ireland in the opening period, while lock Iain Henderson and flyhalf Paddy Jackson, a late replacement for Johnny Sexton, bagged tries in Ireland's second--half fightback which earned them a losing bonus point."That was a cracking game," Hogg said. "We switched off a bit in the start of the second half but the boys are delighted with that result and a great way to kick off the Six Nations here at Murrayfield."The boys stuck to it but credit to Ireland - they were fantastic in the second half," he added.It was an impressive performance by Scotland but perhaps one that fans knew might be on the cards with many of the Glasgow team that demolished Leicester 43-0 in Europe's top-tier club competition just weeks ago in the side.Scotland had not won their opening game of the Six Nations since 2006 and entertaining an Irish side who beat the mighty All Blacks last year was a tough task. England scrape throughAfter a few seasons of mediocrity France finally returned to their old style and, for long periods, outplayed a very poor England, who looked nothing like the Grand Slam-winning side of last year.The half-time score of 9-9 was made up of three penalties to each side. Rabah Slimani's 59th-minute try then put France ahead by 16-12 and they looked as if they were on their way to victory.However, England coach Eddie Jones made several changes, reshuffling the backs and bringing on Ben Te'o, who scored a converted try in the 71st minute to put England ahead at 19-16, which was how the game ended. The fact that England conceded half as many penalties as France may well have been a significant factor.
