The 27 companies will submit a response to Eskom on April 28.The statement on the request for information comes as Eskom dismissed a claim last month that it managed to usurp the nuclear procurement from the Department of Energy. The claims were made in an affidavit made by Earthlife Africa s Johannesburg branch co-ordinator Makoma Lekalakala which was submitted to the Western Cape High Court.The affidavit was made in support of the case brought by the anti-nuclear lobby group and the Southern African Faith Communities Environment Institute (Safcei) to have certain determinations made by Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson declared unlawful and unconstitutional one of those being the 2016 determination designating Eskom as the procurer of 9 600MW from new nuclear energy plants.But the Department of Energy indicated in its Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) last year that only 1 359 megawatt of nuclear power would be added to the country s energy mix by 2037 instead of the previous 2 023 and that renewable energy would form a large part of the energy mix.- TMG Digital/BusinessLIVE
