Judges praised the courage of Burhan Ozbilici, a photographer for Associated Press, who stood his ground as 22-year-old policeman Mevlut Mert Altintas pumped nine bullets into ambassador Andrei Karlov at the opening of an Ankara art exhibition."From the moment I heard the shots I knew this was an historic moment," Ozbilici said."I knew I had to do my job. As a journalist, I couldn't just run away to save my skin."The photo has been viewed about 18 million times around the world.The judges, from the World Press Photo Foundation, in Amsterdam, acknowledged that they had had a tough job in choosing the 2017 winner from more than 80400 images by 5034 photographers from 125 countries."It was a very, very difficult decision, but in the end we felt the picture of the year was an explosive image that spoke about the hatred of our times," said jury member Mary Calvert.Agence France-Presse also scooped three awards.Manila photographer Noel Celis took third place in the general news category for his photo of inmates trying to sleep in an over-populated prison in the city.Syrian snappers Abd Doumany and Ameer Alhalbi won second prize in the spot-news category for their pictures of children caught up in the bombardments of Aleppo and Douma. It is the second year in a row that Doumany's work has been honoured by the World Press Photo Foundation."It's not easy for these photographers, for these Syrians. It's taking terrible risks. They are young guys telling their stories from hell," said jury president Stuart Franklin.</img> FACE OF HATRED: Overall winner, World Press Photo of the Year.
