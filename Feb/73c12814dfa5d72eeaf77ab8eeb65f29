Come August, they - and two others, including Dempers's girlfriend - will be heading back there.This time, during their two-month adventure, they'll also be creating online field classes "out in the jungle" (some of the first from this region) which are open-source and are intended to reach thousands of pupils around the world.You've NEVER seen animals do this before: 'Planet Earth II' will mesmerise youIn 2002, their six-month trip was a roller-coaster ride of jungles, rainforests, alligators, septic mosquito bites, walks in pitch darkness when a truck broke down, 17kg weight loss - and 1000km of paddling in an unwieldy dugout canoe.But the real fear came when tribesmen towed them to their village, stole their canoe and belongings, then kept the explorers in a hut for almost a week, and gave them little food.It was only when the military police arrived that the men - with no idea why they had been held - were taken to safety."I haven't been back," said Dempers at his photography studio in Wellington in the Western Cape, "but what I have learnt since then is that Brazilian Indians in the Amazon are themselves often subjected to kidnapping and killings by the logging companies that operate there - so when they saw two foreigners they thought we were the bad guys."Last time Dempers, now 48, and Brooks, now 79, had no way of contacting anybody, or even each other when they were separated for several days.This time, said Dempers, "the police will be aware of our location".Back then, they had carried simple laminated maps, and Dempers also carried 150 rolls of film, which he had to protect from humidity. This time, their boat will have a solar-powered motor and they'll have GPS."Last time we did it in quite a crazy way. We got the canoe and headed off. We were not always sure of our co-ordinates."But most exciting this time for Dempers is the Educational Adventure, which is based on the STEM concept.A field of learning where science, technology, engineering and maths are taught in unison in the real world, STEM is growing rapidly around the world."We will have satellite communication and will transmit images and voice recordings to our website regularly," said Dempers."It is not just about raising awareness of deforestation. The Amazon is a big magnet that gets people's attention and is perfect to portray STEM as an exciting field."</img>Johan Dempers and fellow adventurer Joe Brooks were captured by indigenous tribesmen in a remote region of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil.

Some things just happen."
