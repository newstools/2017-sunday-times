In December, former president Bill Clinton raised Trump's already-inflamed ire when he said: "Donald Trump doesn't know much, but one thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him."Trump lashed back on Twitter by saying that he didn't call Bill, Bill actually called him and that he (Bill) did not know very much.In November, GQ magazine carried a strongly worded editorial which said: "Not only did an army of angry white guys wrest America back from a black man they never considered American, they did it by defeating a woman who would have, undeniably, forced them to compromise on reproductive-health care, sexual-assault law, and workplace inequality. That's a win-win-win in their book."The Washington Post wrote an editorial saying that Trump's chief advisers had one thing in common: they were all angry white men.Trump supporters have responded to the jibes with ... anger.
