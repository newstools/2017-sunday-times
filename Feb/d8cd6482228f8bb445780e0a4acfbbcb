1) SEE THE STARS SHINEIn terms of celebrities, I was told Abu Dhabi's wealthier locals will fly in just about anyone they want to perform at their private parties and events.The real reason I was there was to see Rihanna perform as part of the 8th Formula 1 Etihad Airways Grand Prix.The three-day event kicked off on a Friday, with Riri performing on the Sunday.The modern icon of music, fashion and entertainment delivered an exquisite show to a 40,000-strong crowd at du Arena on Yas Island.This is Abu Dhabi's biggest live-music venue, with past performers including Coldplay, Madonna, Metallica, Justin Timberlake and The Who. English singer Olly Murs is performing in April.2) VISIT YAS ISLANDKnown as the home of events in Abu Dhabi, this is where you'll find Ferrari World and also the Yas Marina Circuit, Abu Dhabi's Formula 1 track.There's also Waterworld, which has the world's biggest water park and offers raft rides and slides, among other fun splashy activities.3) GO ON SAFARIThe Abu Dhabi Safari Experience with Desert Adventures was like no safari I've ever done in Africa. There are no animals - it's just you, an air-conditioned Toyota Fortuner SUV and vast tracts of glistening golden sand to plough through. Sliding up and down sand dunes in a car full of people in the middle of nowhere is a quite a thrill. Why you should leave the airport and check out Abu DhabiAfter the drive, you hop onto a camel for a ride through the sand - you'll have worked up quite a thirst by the time you reach the Bedouin-style camp for some sundowners and scrumptious dinner of salads, chicken and Arabian bread.

Besides their gourmet seafood fusion cuisine and exotic cocktails, they also serve the most amazing mochi ice cream I've ever tasted.Invented in Japan, mochi ice cream is made up of soft, pounded sticky rice cake on the outside and filled with different ice- cream flavours inside.Before that amazing dessert, I had sushi for starters and a salmon dish with veggies for main.The restaurant is also famous for hosting some of the top international stars and we happened to be there the same day as Canadian rapper Drake.Even though we were not allowed to take pictures of him, we were all excited to be breathing the same air as the "Hotline Bling' hit-maker.
