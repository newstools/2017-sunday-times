It would offer investors free investment accounts with wholesale interest rates and free real-time share data, such as stock prices and share trades, on its website, he said.Agricultural companies Senwes and Senwes Beleggings would list by the end of February.Nel was speaking on Friday after the appeal board of the Financial Services Board (FSB) dismissed with costs two separate but consolidated appeals by the JSE and 4 Africa Exchange (4AX) against an exchange licence for ZAR X.The registrar granted both ZAR X and 4AX exchange licences on August 31 last year.The JSE and 4AX submitted that neither ZAR X nor the registrar of security services complied with the Financial Markets Act, which is intended among other things to ensure financial markets are fair and promote investor protection.However, Judge LTC Harms, deputy chairman of the appeal board, found that both the registrar and ZAR X had complied with the act and that neither of the appellants had engaged with the registrar's reasons for granting the licence.The appeal was "purely a delaying tactic", said Nel. "Both 4AX and the JSE see us a potential threat to their business."ZAR X aims to make low-cost share investing available to the public, while also making it easier for small companies, including BBBEE ownership schemes, to access capital via a stock exchange.Nel said three companies had approached ZAR X to initiate discussions on potential listings since the ruling was handed down late on Thursday afternoon."Our pipeline looks significantly better than it did a month ago."In terms of the act, individuals who want to trade on ZAR X will need to set up accounts with mandated stockbrokers. The exchange had begun talking to stockbrokers in South Africa to get them on board as market participants, Nel said.Investors would not be charged safe custody fees, which would be covered partly by ZAR X, and would pay fees only to transact, he said.Donna Nemer, JSE head of capital markets, said the JSE was disappointed, but would not appeal against the judgment."We will continue to work with the regulator and the rest of the market to ensure we maintain the quality of the capital markets in South Africa."
