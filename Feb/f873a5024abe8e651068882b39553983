Through captain Hlompho Kekana's exquisite 40th-minute free kick and Sibusiso Vilakazi's classy injury-time finish, Sundowns closed the points gap on the chasing pack with five matches in hand but coach Gavin Hunt asked searching questions of Pitso Mosimane's side.The league champions had the resolve to fight for the precious three points but Wits left a calling card.
