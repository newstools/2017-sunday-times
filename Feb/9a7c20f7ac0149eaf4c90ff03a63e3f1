Q: Is sex really good for your skin and hair? I have been in a relationship for a while and suddenly I feel that I look better. Am I imagining it?A: The benefits of having regular sex have been well documented. Sex stimulates the release of oestrogen, a hormone that keeps you young. Sex increases your heart rate and improves blood circulation, including to the skin.The hormone oxytocin, commonly referred to as the "love hormone", is released with each orgasm. This results in lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol and reduced skin inflammation. This, together with the increased blood supply to the skin and the sheen of perspiration, explains why skin "glows" after sex.Why does sex exist? Study may have found the answerSexual stimulation (including masturbation) and having an orgasm can help to keep pain at bay, thanks to the release of hormones that can help to block pain signals and can reduce symptoms of menstrual cramps and even headaches.Sex can help you sleep better due to a hormone called prolactin which promotes feelings of relaxation and sleepiness. This is just one of the reasons some people may find it easier to fall asleep after having sex. Hugging and cuddling helps with bonding and intimacy in relationships, which leads to couples wanting to have more sex and generally being happier.So good sex can make you look better and feel better and enhance your self-esteem. The more of it you have, the more you will benefit.
