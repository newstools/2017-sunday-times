Former members Albe and Verna Durand, expelled last year after a series of bar brawls at the picturesque club next to Munro beach, have hit back by taking over the lease for the site from Transnet.The club, which had itself held the lease before the Durands took it over, has been given 30 days to vacate premises it has occupied for 60 years.The club is fighting to be allowed to keep the site, but members have also vowed not to let the Durands take over.Municipal officials have met the Transnet National Ports Authority in an attempt to resolve the dispute, so far without success.This week Mossel Bay mayor Harry Levendal said: "The property was developed over many years by club members using their own money, and with property and building costs what they are today, it will be impossible to re-establish the club elsewhere."He told the Sunday Times he hoped Transnet would change its mind about letting the Durands have the lease.</img>Club president Wilhelm von Sch tz at the harbour moorings.

I'm quite good across a mic. I'm quite social. Now you can go there any time in the week and it is dead."
