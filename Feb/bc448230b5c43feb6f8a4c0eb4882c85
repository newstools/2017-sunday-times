Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey return with their tumultuous relationship following the cliffhanger that ended the first instalment of the three-part series based on EL James's novels.While the film remains true to its love story narrative that follows the sexual adventures of Grey and Steele, it also intensifies the drama.EL James had Hollywood's hands tied when it came to 'Fifty Shades Darker'The sequel introduces characters Leila Williams (played by Bella Heathcote), one of Grey's former submissives; Mia Grey, his sister, played by Rita Ora; and Elena Lincoln, his former lover, played by Kim Basinger.Lincoln is Grey's ''Mrs. Robinson", the older woman who introduced him to his alternative sexual lifestyle - but in their case the roles were reversed: Grey was the submissive.Drama ensues when Lincoln approaches Steele to tell her that she's the wrong woman for Grey and that she will never be the one to change him.Arguably the most captivating scene, and the perfect collision of past and present, is the meeting of Steele and Williams.Williams breaks into Steele's apartment and confronts her with a gun, demanding to know what secret, special qualities she has that make ''the Master" (Grey) love her.Seeing Grey walk in and fully take on the role of a dominant with Williams finally drives home the internal struggle that he has when dealing with Steele.The confrontation suggests he has not been able to fully be his true, dominant self - begging the question, is Lincoln right? Is Steele stopping Grey from being who he truly is?While the first film's excitement was in the gratuitous sex scenes and the open depiction of nudity, usually considered taboo, the novelty of the couple's graphic trysts has worn off. Gratification comes more through seeing the book's story come to life.WATCH the trailer of 50 Shades Darker50 darkerElements of female empowerment are seen in this film, with Steele continually questioning Grey and refusing to take his word as king.But overall the film is more tepid than it is spankingly hot.Recommended for a boozy girl's night out. We'd give it a five out of 10.
