The pest can cause crop losses of up to 73% in certain conditions and is difficult to control with a single type of pesticide, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.The threat to crops comes as South Africa tries to recover from last year's drought that contributed to a 12% spike in food inflation.Food inflation is expected to decline in the coming months thanks to good rains, which have enabled farmers to expand summer crop production. Defeating invasion by fall armyworm will cost SADC millionsThe size of the harvest could hinge on the extent to which the government and farmers can forge a co-ordinated response to fall armyworm, which has left a trail of destruction in other countries in Africa. The SADC is holding an emergency meeting in Zimbabwe this week to discuss the pest.The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has agreed to an emergency registration procedure for two chemicals that will be used to control the infestation.South Africa could harvest about 11.9million tons of maize this year, according to the Agricultural Business Chamber, which would meet local demand with 2million tons to spare. The government's crop estimates committee will release its first production report for the year later this month."The [fall armyworm] outbreak, if not contained, has potential to reduce production," said Paul Makube, senior agricultural economist at FNB."However, almost 80% of the country's maize is Bt [genetically modified] maize and susceptibility is minimal. The large maize producing areas of South Africa are still relatively pest-free."It was "way too early" to say what the overall impact could be on price and broader market factors, he said.But he noted that the situation could change quickly because fall armyworm spreads rapidly during the moth stage of its life cycle.The grain market has been relatively calm this week, with white maize for July delivery little changed at R2125 a ton and yellow maize at R2195 a ton. Maize prices are much weaker compared with a year ago when some contracts hit the R5000 a ton mark.Prices of soybeans and sunflower have also been trending lower.
