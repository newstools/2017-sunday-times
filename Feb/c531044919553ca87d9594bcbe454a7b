The recent announcement by the Chinese government banning all domestic ivory trade and processing by the end of 2017 offers a glimmer of real optimism in the fight against elephant poaching.The decision is set to disrupt the marketplace for the product, as it will compel legal ivory-processing industries to close down, thereby eliminating the cover under which the illicit ivory trade has flourished.Similarly, the ban will put in place strict mechanisms for ivory collection and disallow the display of ivory products in physical and virtual markets. Discovery raises questions about history of South African ivory tradeWith only about 415,000 elephants remaining in Africa, the step is crucial in ensuring the long-term survival of one of the continent's most iconic species.For a long time, notable entities the world over Interpol, the UN, the World Bank, the Clinton Global Initiative, the EU and Prince William, among others have tried to tackle elephant poaching, and African governments have increasingly been cracking down on poachers and traffickers.But these were not enough to halt the crisis.It is China that has always held the key. China is, after all, the world's largest ivory bazaar, with about 70% of the product ending up in the country.By setting a specific end date for its ivory trade, Beijing has sent a strong signal that ivory's rightful place is on an elephant and not as a decorative item in someone's home.The move is a clear indication that Beijing is making good on its commitment to the AU and African states during the Forum on China-Africa Co-operation, to work together in combating poaching and illegal trade in wildlife.At the forum's 2015 summit, China and the African states committed to conserve Africa's wildlife.This is reflected in the 2016-2018 Action Plan proposed by the Sixth Ministerial Conference in Johannesburg and its recognition of the need to tackle both local poaching and international organised crime, highlighting specific actions to be taken around poaching and trafficking of ivory and rhino horn.Seized ivory comes almost exclusively from recent poaching - studyChina has significantly shifted its approach to investment in Africa, moving from one-off construction projects to a longer-term strategy for engaging Africa through industrialisation, health and security.The importance of providing stable sources of income to affected communities, and framing conservation priorities for the benefit of both Africa and China, is an important part of framing African investment activities as an opportunity for China to support Africa in avoiding the detrimental environmental impacts China experienced in its own rapid growth.These ideals should reframe wildlife and wild lands conservation as an essential component of sustainable development, as highlighted in the AU Vision 2063.China needs to extend its ongoing collaboration with African countries to conserve natural wild land habitats.Beyond the ivory ban, China should support Africa in strengthening the coexistence of wildlife and human industries, with liveable cities and jobs for young people alongside large-scale conservation.This will require co-operation between China and African governments, business and the public.There are strong opportunities to align Africa's sustainable development goals with China's commitment to help African industrialisation and agricultural modernisation.Agricultural production must be sustainably intensified and improved on existing lands to allow other lands to flourish naturally as large landscapes for conservation, wildlife and other economic development associated with unspoilt land.Further, if conservation and sustainable development are going to succeed, jobs need to be created, through industrialisation, so that Africa's large youth population will not depend on exploiting natural resources to achieve a better livelihood. There is need for a paradigm shift in how Africa perceives, manages and benefits from her natural resource assets The African Wildlife Foundation has been working with African ambassadors in Beijing for more than two years to make this an important part of China-Africa diplomacy.We have convened groups of Africans and Chinese businesses and civil society leaders regarding the opportunities for co-operation on African conservation and development challenges.There is need for a paradigm shift in how Africa perceives, manages and benefits from her natural resource assets and how China views its long-term sustainable relationship with Africa.We stand ready to support China, the AU and African states further to achieve the UN sustainable development goals and the AU development agenda Vision 2063.
