Microsoft s new digital civility index released to mark Safer Internet Day places the country last of 14 surveyed.The tech giant s chief online safety officer Jacqueline Beauchere said the index was an attempt to get people to treat each other with respect and dignity online. It may sound simple but (our) research shows people are concerned about the tone of online interactions and worry that risks will increase in the future she said.The survey conducted last June gauged attitudes and perceptions among teenagers and adults. We measured survey respondents lifetime exposure to 17 online risks across four categories: behavioural reputational sexual and personal/intrusive said Beauchere.The top five risks that emerged were unwanted contact being treated meanly trolling receiving unwanted sexts and online harassment.Findings included:- Two out of three respondents said they had fallen victim to at least one risk and the percentage swelled to 78% when participants also accounted for the experiences of their friends and family; - 50% reported being extremely or very worried about life online generally; and - 62% said they did not know or were unsure where to get help when they encountered an online risk.Said Beauchere: We computed the index for each country surveyed as well as an international reading that includes all 14. The index works like a golf score: the lower the value (on a scale from zero to 100) the lower the respondents risk exposure and the higher the perceived level of online civility among people in that country.The international score stands at 65 but South Africa scored 78 with the next rudest countries being Mexico and Russia. The politest countries were the UK which scored 45 Australia and the US. People are establishing social norms online that include treating each other with respect and dignity but there s more that we can all do said Beauchere. We d like to see digital civility grounded in empathy become a universal message and a common-sense behaviour so the internet can be a safe place for everyone to exchange ideas learn play and connect. Microsoft has launched a digital civility challenge encouraging people to:- Show empathy compassion and kindness in every interaction and treat everyone they connect with online with dignity and respect.- Respect differences and honour diverse perspectives and when disagreements surface to engage thoughtfully and avoid name-calling and personal attacks.- Pause before replying to things people disagree with and avoid posting or sending anything that could hurt someone else damage reputations or threaten people s safety.- Stand up for themselves and others by supporting those who are targets of online abuse or cruelty reporting activity that threatens anyone s safety and preserving evidence of inappropriate or unsafe behaviour.-TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
