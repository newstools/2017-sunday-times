The South African Group Coach: Robert du PreezCaptain: Patrick Lambie2016 ranking: Third in South African group, second in Africa 2 Conference, quarterfinalsWhat to expect in 2017: Having kept the bulk of their relatively young squad and a necessary coaching change with Du Preez replacing Gary Gold, they will be expected to be more adventurous. Uncertainty still haunts Super RugbyThey showed improvement in their attacking game during the 2016 Currie Cup tournament and whether they are able to bring those skills to a higher level remains to be seen. No10 Pat Lambie's fitness will also be under the spotlight along with that of scrumhalf Cobus Reinach's.Lambie and Reinach will be crucial to the Sharks' hopes of higher honours and playing an attacking game. They were roundly difficult to watch last season even though their ultra-defensive game got them into the quarterfinals. If they can marry their stinginess with an astute attacking game, they could be a difficult team to handle.They also have the benefit of dispensing with their tour at the start of the tournament.Prospects:With the easier Australian conference, anything less than the quarterfinals will be unforgivable. With the New Zealand teams lying in wait, that is where it could end for the KwaZulu-Natal franchise.Coach: Nollis MaraisCaptain: Handre Pollard2016 ranking: Fourth in South African group, second in Africa 1 ConferenceWhat to expect in 2017:The Bulls seem to thrive on facing New Zealand sides despite their traditional limitations with their kicking game.Under Marais, they have the potential of evolving into a blockbuster, all-weather unit with their crackerjack backline personnel.With Pollard, they have the best No 10 in South Africa and their back three, led by Warrick Gelant, is the envy of the local franchises. If they click, the equally exciting New Zealand sides may not be feared as much. They just have to pick which teams they counterattack against.Last season they struggled to collect bonus points and that proved to be their undoing. However, it was Marais's first Super Rugby coaching stint and he should do much better now.Key to their success will be the combination of their tight five. This is something they never quite got right and to get their good backline going, forward dominance is a prerequisite.Prospects:Three from five against the Kiwi sides will pave the way to a quarterfinal berth. Their tour is early and they don't have to go to Argentina.Coach: Deon DavidsCaptain: Schalk Ferreira2016 ranking: Seventh in South African group, fourth in Africa 2 ConferenceWhat to expect in 2017:The weaker Australian conference should provide a bit of respite, especially with the off-field stability they have enjoyed as compared to last year. They are not expected to blow houses down, but they will be frowned upon if they do not beat the Force (away) and the Rebels (home) while giving the Reds a run for their money.The Brumbies and the Waratahs are better coached teams and should have the beating of them but they need to be competitive in South African derbies. It is difficult to read into their pre-season friendlies and their opening date against the Jaguares at home should provide some insights into how they will fare this season. Also, improved performances will be to the benefit of the troubled yet important rugby region.Prospects:The Kings are not expected to go past the round-robin stages, but improvement is expected of them. Their success is critical for the development of rugby in the Eastern Cape region and for the SA Rugby Union, who have been derelict in their duties towards transformation.Coach: Johan AckermannCaptain: Warren Whiteley2016 ranking: First in Africa 2 Conference and South African group. FinalistsWhat to expect in 2017:Lions captain Warren Whiteley has made it clear they won't deviate from the high-octane game that helped propel them to the final last year.They were one of the fittest teams at the start of the competition and the early wins helped create momentum that sustained them into the play-offs.This time, however, their pre-season has been compromised by injury, while a core of senior players were absent through commitments in Japan.Much of their game plan last year revolved around the front foot ball they got from the set pieces. But with Julian Redelinghuys out of this campaign, the focus shifts squarely onto the shoulders of Ruan Dreyer.Another key player will be scrumhalf Ross Cronje, who went unheralded through much of last year's success.Prospects:To repeat the heroics from last year will be very difficult. The Johannesburg side will still be a force to reckon with and they may yet rule the roost in the South African Conference, but to go as deep as they did last year will be a tough ask. Coach: Franco SmithCaptain: Francois Venter2016 ranking: Third in Africa 1 Conference, sixth in South African group.What to expect in 2017:Last year Smith found the going tough in his first full season in charge of the Cheetahs. He had a taste the previous year but the frustrations of the tournament quickly dawned on him last year.Their home form needs to improve quite markedly and the most obvious way to achieve that is to show greater steel in defence. The Free State franchise scored seven more tries than the Sharks in league play last season, yet the Durban side had more than double their log points.Prospects:The Cheetahs should be a better developed side this season. Players like Uzair Cassiem, Ox Nch and Sergeal Petersen are expected to take the next step.The Cheetahs can certainly draw from their emphatic triumph in the Currie Cup as well as Smith broadening his player base.Whether they can beat their compatriots on a regular basis remains to be seen, but three derbies at home as well as a visit from the Sunwolves could help catapult them to a fast start. A runners-up spot in the South Africa group may be the best they can hope for.Coach: Filo TiatiaCaptain(s): Harumichi Tatekawa, Ed Quirk2016 ranking: Last (fourth) in Africa 1 Conference, last (eighth) in South African groupWhat to expect in 2017: Predictably, the Sunwolves struggled to assert themselves in their first season last year.Yes, they tried to play an exciting ball-shifting brand of rugby but ultimately their game lacked substance. They will need greater forward grunt.They also cannot afford to drop their bundle in defence the way they did against the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein last season. Speaking of which, they now have Willie Britz in their back row, which will only accentuate their ball-in-hand approach.In fact, Britz has been quoted as saying it is the Sunwolves' intention "to play with ball in hand", "get the offloads going" and to "play with width". It is highly commendable, but they will have to do most of it off the back foot.Prospects:They can make an immediate impact this season if they topple the Hurricanes, the defending champions, in their opening game. That is unlikely, however, but it is probably the best time to pull an almighty rabbit out of the hat. They will do well to avoid another wooden spoon.Coach: Raul PerezCaptain: Agustin Creevy2016 ranking: Failed to make play-offs, finishing third in Africa 2. Only won four of 15 matches.What to expect in 2017:The Jaguares were a disappointment in their debut season last year, especially after fielding most of the Pumas team that made the 2015 World Cup semifinals.Ill-discipline was their biggest downfall, which saw them earn eight yellow cards and two reds. If they improve that aspect of their play, they will immediately be better.The Jaguares were also caught between two styles of play last season after the Pumas had so much success with a more expansive approach. The Jaguares tried to take the same template into Super Rugby, but with injuries and inexperience, the complex game plan came unstuck.The squad is more experienced and has more depth after acclimatising for the non-Pumas players last season, while those fringe players are better versed in the game plan.Further good news is that the Jaguares are not drawn against New Zealand opposition in the pool phase while eight of their 15 matches are at home.Prospects in 2017: Challenging for a play-off berth. New Zealand Conference Coach: Chris BoydCaptain: Dane Coles2016 ranking: 1st in Australasian group, 1st in New Zealand conference, ChampionsWhat to expect in 2017: It's clear the Super Rugby trophy is now the property of New Zealand rugby franchises with the Hurricanes finally breaking their duck last year. Defending this hard-earned title is not going to be easy, having lost players like Victor Vito (La Rochelle), Jamison Gibson-Park (Leinster), James Marshall (Gloucester), Willis Halaholo (Cardiff Blues) and Jason Woodward (Bristol).What they haven't lost are their key players like Beauden Barrett and TJ Perenara and the All Black halfback pairing will be crucial to their title defence. The Hurricanes will look to the consistency that guided them last season and the defensive strength that saw them not concede a try in the play-offs on the way to winning their first title. It was a pretty decent end for a side who copped a 52-10 hammering against the Brumbies in Canberra. They could do with a better start but it's how you finish that counts.Prospects: They will have a tough task defending their title but if they are able to negotiate their tough home conference they'll have the easier South African route in the play-offs.Coach: Tony BrownCaptain: Ben Smith2016 ranking: 3rd in Australasian group, 2nd in New Zealand conference, SemifinalistsWhat to expect in 2017: The Highlanders could not be faulted for their game title defence last season but questions remain on whether they can sustain that momentum. They have a new coach in the experienced Brown. Their key losses have been front-row ones with Ross Geldenhuys (Southern Kings) and Josh Hohneck (Gloucester).They still have the Smiths (Ben and Aaron) to call on while acquisition of exciting youngster Tevita Li from the Blues bolsters their already excellent back three.The Highlanders have all their bases covered and it's a case of how they adapt to the new coach even though he was Jamie Joseph's long-time assistant.The Highlanders have been a side who have thrived on the sum of their parts being the core of the whole with "no name" players. If Brown is able to coax the same fighting spirit Joseph was able to, the Highlanders will be a handful.Prospects: A quarterfinal is not beyond them, even though they will be better suited to doing the business at home instead of travelling for crucial matches.Coach: Dave RennieCaptains: Sam Cane and Aaron Cruden2016 ranking: 4th in Australasian group, 3rd in New Zealand conference, SemifinalistsWhat to expect in 2017: In what will be Cruden's final season with the North-Western franchise, the onus will be on them to finally become the fully-fledged product that won back-to-back titles in 2012 and 2013.They've had some big midfield losses in Sonny-Bill Williams (Blues) and Seta Tamanivalu (Crusaders) even though Anton Leinert-Brown has become their midfield fulcrum.With Charlie Ngatai still suffering from concussion, they are bolstered by Tim Nanai-Williams's return from Japan. They've also lost key forwards in Pauliasi Manu (Blues), Siati Tokolahi (Highlanders) and Johan Bardoul (Yamaha Jubilo).However, Rennie is not known for being Mr Moneyball for nothing as the two titles were built on no-name players.However, they had the weakest set of forwards among the New Zealand teams but they have always found a way to thrive.Prospects: They still have the look of a quarterfinal team, but the difficult nature of the New Zealand conference means nothing can be taken for granted.Coach: Scott RobertsonCaptain: Sam Whitelock2016 ranking: 5th in Australasian group, 4th in New Zealand conference, QuarterfinalistsWhat to expect in 2017: Under new coach Robertson, the Crusaders will be expected to break out of their underachievement cocoon. They have been enveloped there since their seventh title win in 2008.They may have lost their multi-talented Fijian giant in Nemani Nadolo (Montpellier) but there's the acquisition of former Reds wing Digby Ioane.There's also the captaincy change that sees Whitelock replacing All Black captain Kieran Read ahead of what will be an important year with the British and Irish Lions series in June.Robertson has also managed to retain the core of the powerful forwards that served Todd Blackadder well.The Crusaders have everything they need to win their eighth title but putting the right ingredients together for the perfect Championship winning stew is another story.It remains to be seen whether Robertson and Whitelock can do what eluded the Richie McCaw/Blackadder trio since 2009.Prospects: Anything less than a play-off berth is regarded as a failure in Christchurch.Coach: Tana UmagaCaptains: James Parsons and Jerome Kaino2016 ranking: 7th in Australasian group, 5th in New Zealand conferenceWhat to expect in 2017: The time for improvement is now over and delivering needs to be the order of the season. While they were comfortably the worst of the New Zealand franchises, they knocked off a few big teams. They may have lost Bryn Hall (Crusaders), but Tawera Kerr-Barlow's and Brad Weber's excellence meant Augustine Pulu had to find a home in Auckland. They have also acquired Pauliasi Manu (Chiefs) and Alex Hodgman (Crusaders).A problem for them could be at flyhalf were Ihaia West was journeyman at best while Piers Francis's emergence came too late in the season to turn their fortunes around.Their other backline positions are well covered but they will also need George Moala and Sonny-Bill Williams to fire if they are to have a chance.Prospects: At best, they will aim for a top five conference finish before they even entertain thoughts of a quarterfinal berth.They'll topple a few South African and New Zealand sides but before they even think of play-offs, they need to deal with their compatriots decisively. Australian Conference Coach: Stephen LarkhamCaptain: Sam Carter2016 ranking: First in Australian Conference, second in Australasian group. QuarterfinalsWhat to expect in 2017:The Brumbies did well to top their conference in the face of financial and boardroom woe last season.They will need similar resilience with a number of senior players unavailable for this campaign.Star flank David Pocock is on a six-month sabbatical, former skipper Stephen Moore has rejoined the Reds, while halfbacks Christian Lealiifano and Tom s Cubelli are injured.Lealiifano has been named co-captain along with Carter but his duties will be limited to those off the field.Anthony Fainga'a is back in their ranks but their player balance sheet makes for poorer reading.Coach Larkham will have to work his magic if his side is going to be in the mix in the latter stages.Prospects:The Brumbies suffered a huge defeat to the Waratahs in a warm-up match and although one should not read too much into those matches, their resources already seem a little thin.They start with a tough assignment away in Christchurch where they haven't won since 2000. They won the Australian Conference last season but they can expect a tougher challenge this year. Coach: Dave WesselsCaptain(s): Ben McCalman, Heath Tessmann2016 ranking: Last (fifth) in Australian Conference, last (10th) in Australasian group.What to expect in 2017:The Force have in recent seasons worn the tag of being the most unimaginative team in Super Rugby. Watching their matches has required a very deep love for the sport but hopefully new coach Wessels can inject some verve and vigour into the franchise.The Force will want to start with a bang as Super Rugby looks likely to redraw their franchise boundaries next month. They held the wooden spoon in their conference last season and they could be exposed to a cull.At least they will go into the new campaign with new men pulling the strings. They have a new coach who has installed backrower McCalman and hooker Tessmann as co-captains. Former captain Matt Hodgson opted to relinquish the position, leaving McCalman to run the show on field, while Tessmann will take charge of off-field affairs.Tessmann may find it tricky to dislodge the considerable Tatafu Polota-Nau from the starting team.Prospects:The Force will play with grit and desperation but ultimately their early season gusts will subside by mid-term.Coach: Tony McGahanCaptain: Nick Stirzaker2016 ranking: Third in Australian Conference, eighth in Australasian groupWhat to expect in 2017:The Rebels were the surprise package of last year's tournament but they ran out of steam just as they needed to surge.They did, however, win fans with a daring brand of rugby but ultimately their lack of depth proved their undoing.Like the Force, they too have a point to prove.Their right of existence in Super Rugby has also been questioned now that the size of the competition is again up for debate.They are the newest franchise in Australia and as such, possibly the most vulnerable when you factor in their chances of bailing out.Expect utility-back Reece Hodge to again make an impact.Prospects:The Rebels will again be one of Australia's most daring sides and although they will pull off the odd giant killing, it won't happen often enough to elevate them to a play-off spot.It will be interesting, however, if they were to be in contention for the play-offs near the end of the league stages.They finish their league commitments against the Force and at home to the Jaguares.Coach: Nick StilesCaptain: James Slipper2016 ranking: Fourth in Australian Conference, ninth in Australasian groupWhat to expect in 2017:The Reds boast 13 new signings to their ranking.They have Wallabies captain Stephen Moore back in their player pool, while loose forwards Leroy Houston and George Smith will team up in an impressive back row on paper. Brisbane Broncos converts Caleb Timu and Lachlan Maranta are also in the Reds' mix.It may not necessarily improve performance but it will make them worth watching, at least in the opening rounds.Since their triumph in the 2011 competition, the Reds have slipped backwards at a rate of knots but there is renewed optimism in their ranks.They certainly have more experience with 540 test caps in their ranks compared to the 355 of last year. After disappointing last year, watch out for fullback Karmichael Hunt.Prospects:The Reds will grab a lot of attention in this year's competition. Queensland has a fine rugby tradition and lots of resources have been pooled to try to make this season's competition a success.They will almost certainly contest conference supremacy but whether they can live with New Zealand's best is another matter. Coach: Daryl GibsonCaptain: Michael Hooper2016 ranking: Second in Australian Conference, sixth in Australasian groupWhat to expect in 2017:The Waratahs missed out on a place in the play-offs last season.They were arguably the best-resourced team in Australia but they came up short and only the Brumbies made it to the quarterfinals.Expect Kiwi coach Gibson to increasingly put his stamp on the squad he inherited from current Australia head coach Michael Cheika.The 'Tahs had an abrasive edge with Cheika in charge and whether that part of their make-up will be further blunted this season remains to be seen.Gibson will, however, bring touches and refinement to a Waratahs team that struggled to find consistency last year.Where will wing Israel Folau pop-up most?Prospects:The 'Tahs will be in the upper echelons of their conference but their sights have to be higher. For that to happen, however, they will need to boss New Zealand teams with greater frequency.With their season in the balance last year, they lost three out of four matches to New Zealand opposition towards the end of the league stages.Earlier, they had lost at home to the Highlanders. The Kiwi monkey is being a beast.
