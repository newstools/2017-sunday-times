Our views on the world have certainly been challenged.For the global mining industry, the past year has brought some reprieve. While market watchers were ready to sound a death knell on mining's prospects, we are still here: stronger than we were before, despite the continuing ebb and flow of sentiment and prices.To paraphrase Mark Twain, who once had the unenviable task to counter false rumours of his death: "The reports of mining's death are greatly exaggerated."Of course, we are not out of the woods yet. We still have a lot of work to do to regain broad stakeholder confidence in the global mining industry. Flexibility needed to realise BEE dreamIn our particular case, many people still don't understand that the owners of most South African publicly listed mining companies are not the "Randlords" or magnates of the previous generations, but rather ordinary pension and investment fund owners - that is, average South African citizens of all races: black, white, coloured and Indian.And so, I hope people will understand that white and even black monopoly capital is a conversation that should be condemned to a difficult and dark South African past.Despite our challenges and the dubious objectives of those wanting to redefine our current reality, there has never been such an opportune time to reinvigorate "the promise of mining".The stage is set: we need to do things differently to find new, safe, responsible and cost-effective ways to mine the ore bodies to meet the needs of a rapidly urbanising global population; a population that is estimated to reach 9.5billion by 2050, with an even faster-growing consumer class in the emerging world.But, to realise this opportunity, the global climate requires that we ask ourselves some tough questions.I would like to share my thoughts on how we can redefine mining's future, to build more resilient and successful companies and a more resilient industry that society better understands and values. We recognise that the only way that we will maximise business success is if we help create thriving mining communities, continue to build on the positive impact of mining, reduce our environmental footprint and become more accountable partners.In this regard, I turn to South Africa, a key mining jurisdiction for us as a global, diversified mining company. As a first step, I often make the point that everything we do relies on stable regulatory frameworks, around which we can plan and invest for the long term.Today, I want to deliberately move away from pointing fingers. I want to argue that, to unlock South Africa's latent potential, different stakeholder groups - the mining industry, investors and host communities - each require something from our regulators, and government more broadly, for us to deliver on mining's transformative promise.For investors, it goes without saying that regulatory certainty and the sanctity of private ownership under the constitution are paramount. They need to know that their capital is invested in a jurisdiction that has clear, fair and reasonable prescripts on the regulation of mining.For us, as mining companies, a business environment that promotes the ease of doing business over lengthy and complicated processes - which sometimes land up in the courts unnecessarily - could unlock more opportunities. I could go on forever, sketching the vision that would make South African mining the giant it once was. The natural resources that have been bestowed on South Africa provide an opportunity to develop so much potential. It just needs us to all lift ourselves above our narrow individual interests - and work to better serve the needs of our core stakeholders.In today's world, capital has no colour; it is a powerful tool that can help create a better country for all.In our case, 64% of the mines we operate and those we empowered are effectively owned by South Africans - through direct and indirect shareholdings.If I assume 27% direct black ownership in our mines, and add to this the participation by black South Africans in pension funds and directly on the JSE, black South Africans own more than 45% of our South African operating assets.For many companies, resilience is a difficult goal to pursue. It is tough - when constantly in the face of uncertain market conditions and a fast-changing world - to keep striving for improvement and progress, not knowing what the future holds for you. Mine bosses warn on 'sledgehammer' safety inspectionsWhile the worst for the industry may be passing, tough times lie ahead: steep price declines in 2014 and 2015, China's growth slowdown, and the increased volatility of commodity pricing, no longer necessarily driven by supply and demand fundamentals, should be seen as the "new normal" for mining.Resilience, as an end-goal, needs pillars to lean on. If we can assume that you have a sound asset base, an appropriate business model and strategy, then in my view, creating a culture of innovation and thinking differently about sustainability are two areas that can help define a new future.Successful innovation is a foundation for resilience - being able to weather the bad times, create change rather than react to it, improve productivity, access the hitherto inaccessible ore bodies and actively develop new markets for our products.Sustainability has to be mining's "north star".When we are better stewards of our natural environment, mine safely and responsibly, operate within thriving communities that own our success and have open and co-operative relationships with our stakeholders, the end result is a company that will thrive.In the opening sentence of his 1953 classic, The Go-Between, British novelist LP Hartley wrote these words, which have become proverbial for any individual, company or country seeking to pave a way for the future: "The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there."We can learn lessons from our past, but it serves little purpose in defining our future. Ours is to redefine mining today, for our new tomorrow.Cutifani is CEO of Anglo American. This is a shortened version of a speech he delivered at the Mining Indaba in Cape Town this week
