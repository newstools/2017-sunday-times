The former St John's College pupil had spent the previous three years working with Obama.As an associate of the Office of Scheduling and Advance in the White House, Morgan, 27, co-ordinated more than 30 domestic and foreign trips for Obama, former vice-president Joe Biden and former first lady Michelle Obama.He said he had frequently travelled ahead of the president to prepare a trip, negotiating with foreign governments, and had worked closely with the US Secret Service, the White House Communications Agency and the teams responsible for Air Force One and Marine One."I primarily managed presidential and vice-presidential motorcades, but I also frequently oversaw some logistics for the White House press corps, local and foreign media."

My role ended with the change in administration."But Morgan has no aspirations for a career in politics.He is now based in New York, "pursuing a career as an entrepreneur in the world of technology start-ups".
