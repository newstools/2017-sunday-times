Q: I am travelling to the US via Dubai and am worried about whether flights from the Middle East, specifically countries whose citizens have been barred from entering the US, will be affected. I am South African. - Anwar MoosaAs a South African, you should not be affected even indirectly.US President Donald Trump's ban on travellers from seven countries should have no effect on other nationalities, although there are fears that the ban could be extended to others. The countries are Syria, Libya, Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Iran.The ban does, however, affect airlines' pilots and flight attendants too. They have had to check where their crew are from, and remove those affected from US-bound flights. Dubai-based Emirates, presumably your airline, had to quickly change pilot and flight-attendant rosters on its daily flights to 11 US cities.Etihad Airways of Abu Dhabi has also taken steps to ensure there will be no issues for its flights.
