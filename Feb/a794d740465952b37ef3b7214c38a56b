Far-flung country areas often have a tendency to produce some intrepid but hard-working cricketers. Knights and newly capped Proteas seamer Duanne Olivier is the latest example.Not even he recalls if he's the best thing to come from the town known for its fertile soil and the variety of fruit and vegetables it produces.What cannot be forgotten is the excellence Olivier displayed in the 2016/17 Sunfoil Series won by the Knights last weekend through the collection of 52 scalps at 18.13.He shied away from taking credit for the title, especially when fast-bowling partner Marchant de Lange was a distant second with 34 wickets at 27.64. Prince and Boje find their mojo on the sidelines"I didn't want to set a goal of taking 50 wickets this season because I knew it was going to be hard work but it was very special to get there," Olivier said."I'm very pleased to have got to the mark because it wasn't easy getting there. However, the Knights winning the title [Sunfoil Series] was a great team effort because everyone in the unit bowled exceptionally well and I just happened to reap the benefits."It would have been very unfair of me because Marchant bowled very well and so did Mbulelo Budaza and Shadley van Schalkwyk. I don't think it'd have been done without them."The 24-year-old catapulted himself into test match reckoning and made his debut in the innings and 118-run hammering of Sri Lanka in the third test at the Wanderers last month.It eased considerable selection headaches caused by Kyle Abbott's Kolpak-enforced retirement at the conclusion of the New Year's test.Dale Steyn's expected comeback during the England tour and Morne Morkel slowly making his way back into the game lengthen the queue.At the time of going to print, Olivier has yet to play limited overs franchise cricket but hopes to make the most of the chance should it come.Red-ball cricket remains his first love, with 253 first-class wickets at 20.49 in 61 matches since his debut in 2011, backing up that unstinting commitment.He has only played 24 List-A matches with 29 wickets in the same period."I haven't played a lot of limited overs cricket because I really enjoy four-day cricket," Olivier said."It needs you to be patient but I enjoy being patient and bowling with the old ball when it starts to reverse."The temptation is there but test cricket at the moment is the ultimate thing. What I don't forget is that there have been other guys who have been picked before me and whoever the selectors pick, I'm happy."Dale Steyn is coming back and so is Morne and they're the best in the business. I just need to be patient and keep on working hard."
