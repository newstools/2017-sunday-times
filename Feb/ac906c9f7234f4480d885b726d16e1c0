There are three lazy ways to experience Lisbon without leaving your couch. If you're arty, watch Lisbon Story by Wim Wenders on YouTube - a moody flick which put the fado/folk group Madredeus on the map. Fans of Jeremy Irons can hire Night Train to Lisbon for a soppy romantic story, while the thirsty can quaff this delicious red blend with a cartoon of an iconic Lisbon tram on the label.Wine of the week: Chamonix Troika 2014A chewy blend of Aragonez, Castel o, and Touriga Nacional, this wine shot to prominence when it was featured on a BBC Saturday morning cooking programme. Celebrity chef James Martin raved about it and even bought three cases. He must have paid close to 7.50 (R125) a bottle, while in Lisbon it changes hands for 3.80 (R54) - only 10% more than at Checkers.Great with Nando's chicken, leit o assado (roast suckling pig) or feij o (black bean stew). Aragonez (also known as Tempranillo) is from Aragon, the medieval Spanish kingdom at the foot of the Pyrenees, while folks in Calitzdorp will be more familiar with its Port persona: Tinta Roriz.The tram depicted on the label was made by Antonio Mendes Lopes, a former professor of psychiatry in Denmark. That Rui Lu s Mendes was the "Butcher of Lisbon" in Night Train has nothing to do with anything, but is something to ask Lopes if you're ever in his Vidigal tasting room in the town of Leiria, close to the best surfing beach on the Atlantic coast of Portugal.Price per bottle: R49Where to buy?
