The 31-year-old striker said he hoped to "play a full part" in the rest of the Premier League club's season.United boss Jose Mourinho had refused to rule out the prospect of Rooney's exit this month, although a deal before the Chinese transfer window closes on February 28 was always unlikely."It's an exciting time at the club and I want to remain a part," said Rooney. Aguero is pricelessRooney's agent, Paul Stretford, had travelled to China to see if he could negotiate a deal, although it is not known which clubs he spoke to.Two of the three clubs who looked the most likely options - Beijing Guoan and Jiangsu Suning - dismissed speculation about a transfer.Rooney's representatives had already spoken to the third option - Tianjin Quanjian - but their coach, Fabio Cannavaro, said talks did not progress.Rooney is United's record scorer and has won five Premier League titles and a Champions League trophy since joining them as an 18-year-old for 27-million from Everton in 2004.The forward, whose contract expires in 2019, has said he would not play for an English club other than United or Everton.United are sixth in the Premier League and remain in three cup competitions, having reached the last 16 of the Europa League on Wednesday.They face Southampton in the EFL Cup final today before taking on Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter finals on March 13."Despite the interest which has been shown from other clubs, for which I'm grateful, I want to end recent speculation and say that I am staying at Manchester United," Rooney said in a statement."I hope I will play a full part in helping the team in its fight for success on four fronts. It's an exciting time at the club and I want to remain a part of it," he said. Conte and Jones meet to talk about the winning mentalityRooney's statement settles his short-term future but does nothing to address long-term issues over his future.He has only started eight Premier League matches this season - fewer than Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Henrikh Mkhitaryan - and has featured only three times since breaking United's scoring record at Stoke City last month.However, should he not play regularly between now and the end of the season, he would explore other options.These would include Major League Soccer in the US, as well as China. It is understood his previous statement, that he would only play for United or Everton in the Premier League, still stands.Interest from China is genuine, but despite long-time adviser Stretford travelling to the country this week, there was never any realistic possibility of completing a deal before Tuesday's Chinese Super League transfer deadline.Former Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp says Rooney would be an "ideal" signing for United's Premier League rivals Arsenal."Arsenal lack somebody like Rooney - a winner, a leader," Redknapp, 69, told BBC Radio 5 live.
