A trampoline can make you feel like a superhero. It catapults your physical abilities into the stratosphere, even if you aren't the athletic type - suddenly you can jump higher and faster, tumble like a gymnast, feel taller and more flexible.Which is why Bounce trampoline parks are a wonderful form of exercise and family fun.The concept is new to South Africa but is already well-established in the US, Europe, Asia and Australia. It takes the basic backyard trampoline experience to a new level - multiple, interconnected trampolines surrounded by padding for safety.Inner-city runs put the fun back into exerciseI was thrilled to add steps to my daily quota of 10,000 by jumping for an hour, and got a workout while the kids bounded about nearby in a space that is fun, safe and good for the family's collective health.It is nearly impossible to work out with children in other settings and get maximum benefit, but this is a sweat-inducing, high-energy option.You can emulate Michael Jordan on the trampoline-enhanced basketball court, flop like a Russian Olympian onto inflatable bags, tackle obstacle courses, take (safe) leaps of faith from platforms, and do other things you have so far only dreamt about.There are sections for young kids, gaming areas with dodgeball or basketball for tweens and high-skill areas for those who want to play Spider-Man. Admire the experienced bouncers and staff as they bounce on their backs, then walk up walls sideways to frenetic music.Around R160 an hour for adults, including grip socks. There are venues around Gauteng, and it's coming soon to the rest of the country. To find out more, visit the BounceSouthAfrica Facebook page and their Instagram @bouncesouthafrica
