After all, international cricketers have to rely on what works for them at domestic level to thrive on the international stage.It's the maturity that has been missing from Miller's game since he made his one-day-international debut in the West Indies in 2010.Hundreds in difficult situations against Sri Lanka (117 not out in 98 balls from 108/4) and Australia (118 not out in 79 balls from 179/4 chasing 371) are testament to his growth. Domingo pondering a declaration as job goes up for grabs"I hope every year can be Miller year, not just 2017 but I just want to keep on enjoying my cricket and if I do that, I'll give the ball every chance of flying out of the park," Miller said."They say you mature when you get older, but I'm really enjoying the space I'm in at the moment. Contributing to team wins is something that I work towards and batting in the middle order, I'll be judged on how I finish matches and the kind of situation I come into."I've had my fair share of disappointments and failures but I've had to learn from them very quickly."Miller was part of the 2013 Champions Trophy unit that was comfortably beaten by England in the semifinal at the Oval.In that fateful match on a muggy London morning, South Africa slipped to 80/8 before Miller compiled an unbeaten 51-ball 55 alongside Rory Kleinveldt (43) in a 95-run partnership that gave South Africa a semblance of respectability.Four years on and Miller may get the chance to correct that ICC trophy failing, especially with Rilee Rossouw's Kolpak-enforced exit alleviating the middle-order congestion.Having found the ability to convert 50s into 100s in pressure situations, Miller has filled the void left by Rossouw.Miller also saw the benefits of having him and Behardien in the same team if the allrounder bug doesn't bite the selectors."Rilee's departure has opened up a gap in the middle order and he's been a top-order batsman. Farhaan and I have been middle-order batsmen and the experience we have is invaluable. 'Fudge' has done very well in the last year and a half and come into his own. If seven batsmen are selected with Fudge and I at six and seven, it's an immensely strong batting lineup and it helps having the two of us in the same team," Miller said."I feel a lot more prepared for this year's Champions Trophy than I was for the 2013 edition so I'm moving in the right direction."
