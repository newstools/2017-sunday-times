"The most negative topic of discussion was the fact that he was laughing as he started his speech," said BrandsEye's analysis of social media comments before, during and after Thursday night's parliamentary tumult.Not that it mattered much. "People were mostly just critical towards Zuma, saying nothing he says can help him regain his credibility," said Patrick Gordon, the Cape Town company's marketing manager."No one expected to hear anything meaningful, and thus expectations were met. A general sense of apathy pervaded the conversation, with Zuma lacking the credibility to drive emotion either way." ANC response lays bare party rivalries ANC's SONA response lays bare party rivalriesBrandsEye's artificial intelligence software correctly predicted the results of the US presidential election and the Brexit vote in the UK.Its state of the nation analysis began a week before the address and continued as Zuma went from parliament to speak to ANC members on the Grand Parade."People said they enjoyed Zuma's singing [at the Parade] more than his speeches and that he should rather sing his speeches," said Gordon.Thursday's social media needle went off the scale between 8pm and 9pm, when the confrontation between the EFF and Speaker Baleka Mbete reached its violent climax."One of the most talked about topics was Julius Malema's 'roasting' of Mbete," said Gordon."There were 2,092 mentions here and people were generally supportive of Malema's view."Social media gave Mbete another roasting, "with many feeling that her conduct was not suitable and that she did not do enough to keep the house in order".Gordon added: "There was also a high volume of comments related to the forcible removal of the EFF, many feeling that this was unlawful. Citizens also felt that after the EFF was removed the Sona became boring and not worth watching."The greatest social media activity was in Gauteng, which racked up 40,000 mentions.Numerous social media posts called Zuma a "tsotsi" after the EFF chanted the word at him."Many supported the sentiment that he is a criminal and therefore is not legally allowed to hold office," said Gordon.
