The greatest football story now has the most remarkable twist. Nine months after engineering the most incredible league triumph in living memory, the Fifa world coach of the year has been summarily dismissed.To put that into even sharper focus, the sacking came just 16 days after Leicester City publicly pledged their "unwavering support" for 65-year-old Italian Claudio Ranieri.And football clubs wonder why there is so much scepticism about the statements they make. Manchester City boss Guardiola vows more of same after Monaco goalfestIt felt like the wrong move for Leicester to deliver that pledge, although, to be charitable, it may have been their last throw of the dice to try and convince the players he was going nowhere.Not that Leicester wanted to sack Ranieri, why would they?They knew - if nothing else - that it would become a part of the story; last season's story. It would be like one of those films where there is a twist in the final credits, in which everything we have just watched is turned on its head.When Ranieri - surrounded by his triumphant Leicester City squad - lifted the Premier League trophy at the King Power Stadium on May 7 last year, it concluded arguably one of the greatest stories in British and world sport.His first season in charge, following an appointment greeted with a wave of indifference, ended with a success that defied history, logic, the odds and the game's natural financial order, as he turned a Leicester team that narrowly avoided relegation into real champions.The day Ranieri, in a stadium cloaked dramatically in storm clouds, but fuelled by undiluted emotion, led blind tenor Andrea Bocelli to the centre circle to start the title celebrations seemed an age away as Leicester brutally sacked the man who gave the club its greatest moment.So how has football's greatest fairy-tale descended into a nightmare in just nine months?After 26 matches last year they were top on 53 points, two ahead of Tottenham Hotspur .This season, they are 17th after 25 matches, with only 21 points. Last season, they had lost only three matches compared with 14 in this campaign, and conceded only 29 goals compared with 43 this term.Indeed, they only conceded 36 in the entire 2015/16 season. The difference is stark and, very clearly in the opinion of Leicester's owners, dangerous.

It will still, however, be a very hard sell given Ranieri's history-making effort last season.Gary Lineker, former Leicester and England striker, tweeted: "After all that Claudio Ranieri has done for Leicester City, to sack him now is inexplicable, unforgivable and gut-wrenchingly sad."Lineker echoed the thoughts of the majority who aired their views publicly - but is there actually method in what many see as the madness of the club's Thai owners? When Leicester face Liverpool tomorrow, it will now most certainly be a highly charged occasion at the King Power.
