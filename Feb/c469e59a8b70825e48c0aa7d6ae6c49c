Instead of worrying that the food in your cooler box might have got a bit squished on your drive out, just pay a R20 picking fee and (once you ve weighed and paid for them) enjoy your strawberries fresh from the ground.Picking is available from Wednesday to Sunday, 9am to 3pm, but make sure that you call ahead to confirm the farm is open for picking, as strawberry activities are halted when there s extreme weather.Sex-on-a-plate: Aphrodisiac ingredients to cook with this Valentine s DayThey say that cooking is love made visible, so there s no better way to spend the feast of St Valentine than getting hot in the kitchen with your special someone.Wicked Food Cooking School in Sunninghill is running two Romantic Valentine s dinner classes (on 11 and 14 February) where you ll get a chance to prepare an incredible six-course dinner and then enjoy it together.
