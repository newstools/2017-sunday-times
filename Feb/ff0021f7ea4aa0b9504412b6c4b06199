Joseph's void is set to be filled by Elliot Daly. The Wasps back has featured on the wing in the past four games but his favoured position is outside centre.Daly also featured there ahead of Joseph in the 37-21 win over South Africa in November.At an opening training session at Twickenham last Friday, Daly featured in that position outside Owen Farrell at flyhalf and Ben Te'o at inside centre, which if selected would mean George Ford dropping to the bench. Te'o has impressed as an impact replacement for Jones but is yet to start a match. Conte and Jones meet to talk about the winning mentalityAs a gainline-breaking ball carrier, his selection would be a significant departure from the twin-playmaker tactic Jones has previously employed with Ford and Farrell at 10 and 12.After opening the Six Nations Championship with victories over France and Wales, Jones was expected to experiment against Italy who have conceded 96 points in defeats. Bath's Anthony Watson is included in the squad after missing the autumn internationals and then the opening two Six Nations matches with injuries. He broke his jaw at an England training camp in October and picked up a hamstring injury last month.With Mike Brown poised to be selected at fullback, Watson will battle fellow speedster Jonny May for the wing slot vacated by Daly; Jack Nowell is in line to fill the other wing berth. Henry Slade, the Exeter playmaker, has also been selected by Jones after a period out of the England reckoning.In the pack Mako Vunipola, the loosehead prop, will make his first appearance of the Championship. The 26-year-old returned for Saracens against Gloucester on Friday after two months out with a knee injury, but is set to be on the replacements bench with Joe Marler retaining his starting berth.There could be a change on the other side of the scrum with Kyle Sinckler, the precocious Harlequins tighthead, pushing Dan Cole for selection while James Haskell is likely to figure in the backrow permutation.England announced its team to face Italy on Friday.Italy coach Conor O'Shea has already announced four changes to the side was got thrashed 63-10 by Ireland.Exeter's Michele Campagnaro starts at outside centre and wing Guilo Bisegni and blindside flank Braam Steyn are also promoted. The most interesting change is at flyhalf where Tommaso Allan comes in for Carlo Canna, whom England had expected to be facing.
