Spokesman Kagisho Mamabolo said the figure included 67 875 first-time students and 107 474 returning students. Although the NSFAS application closing date was January 20 some universities are still in the process of concluding their examinations. We therefore expect the number of funded students to increase. Mamabolo said that while the allocation of grants for first-time students was a priority NSFAS had agreed with tertiary institutions that the management of returning students be coordinated.This was to ensure that returning students could be accepted and registered immediately if they met criteria spelled out by NSFAS which included them having received financial aid last year.A total of 9976 applications for funding were rejected for failing to meet eligibility criteria. Students can appeal. TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
