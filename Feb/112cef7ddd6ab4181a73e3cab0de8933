The FAO, the convener of a regional meeting scheduled for Harare on Tuesday, hopes that regional governments will commit sufficient finances to tackle the fall armyworm."The funds for fighting the pest will come from the governments and already, Zambia has put in about $3-million. We are not sure about Zimbabwe, but authorities there have provided their farmers with pesticides and South Africa will provide [them] as well," Chimimba David Phiri, the FAO's sub-regional co-ordinator for Southern Africa, said this week.The meeting would produce a co-ordinated response from the region, Phiri said, as he ruled out the possibility of a fund against the fall armyworm being set up by the UN agency. Tests confirm fall armyworm plague"Those countries which might not have enough resources can ask for help from their developmental partners. The idea is to have a coordinated approach for all the affected countries ... If one country is lax in dealing with the pest, it becomes counter-productive for everyone else," he said.South Africa's Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries confirmed it would take part in the FAO regional meeting this week.Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Namibia, Mozambique and most recently, South Africa, have all found the fall armyworm within their borders.However, a proper assessment of the damage to crops due to the pest is still limited.Reports suggest that about a tenth of Zambia's million hectares of maize is affected, in Malawi more than 2000ha, while in Namibia two green schemes of 2,200ha in the Zambezi region were infested, causing $1.7-million in losses.In South Africa, the test results confirmed the pest's presence in Limpopo, Free State, North West, Mpumalanga and Gauteng provinces.Particularly in South Africa the outbreak will have far-reaching consequences and threaten food security for the entire SADC region.South Africa grows nearly half of the 30-million tons of maize produced in the region."Should there be a major outbreak in South Africa, this would certainly worsen the outlook for inflation, which has mainly been driven by elevated food price increases at 12.5% year on year in December 2016 . [although] the country is better prepared than some of its neighbours to contain any outbreak," said Gert Nel, an analyst at NKC Economics.Agriculture experts are cautiously optimistic that South Africa would still be able to deliver a good harvest.Wessel Lemmer, an agri-economist at Absa, said the bank did not think the crop estimates committee (CEC) would be revising the maize forecast as emergency measures were being put in place to control the spread."We do not expect the outlook to change because the invasion should be effectively dealt with by the measures being taken," Lemmer said.The Absa Agri Trends report for 2017 issued last week suggested that if favourable weather continued total production of maize might rise from 7.5-million tons to 11-7 million tons, spurring a reduction in imports from 2.5-million tons to zero in the new season.Bomikazi Molapo, spokeswoman for the department, said the outbreak was still being evaluated. "It's too soon to predict the decision of the CEC. At the moment they are still awaiting the reports of surveys from the Agricultural Research Council and its partners."The regional outbreak is thought to have originated in Zambia around December last year. Findings by researchers suggest that rapid outbreaks of the pest tend to happen after long dry spells.The SADC region suffered its most severe drought during the El-Nino weather pattern last season, which decimated crops and livestock.Stewart Wilson, a consulting entomologist in Harare, said it was still curious how the fall armyworm was able to spread exponentially throughout the region so quickly."The farming communities are still struggling to know what it is that they are dealing with. It's likely that the pest was already tolerant to certain pesticides used on it in South America ... it survives and evolves." Bumper year for maize, if killer pest is beatenPart of the speculation is that the introduction has been accidental, that easy air travel had increased phytosanitary risk and that climate change variations in high altitude wind streams may have favoured the shift from one continent to another, said Bridget O'Connor of the Kasisi Agricultural Training Centre in Zambia.Irene Maphenduka, a farmer in the Nyamandlovu area in Zimbabwe, is among those counting their losses even before regional governments come together to find common ground against the pest."It's been very difficult; you spray in one part of your farm and it [fall armyworm] then appears in another part. I have just left the fields as they are because it is so hard to keep up," Maphenduka said.A biting liquidity crisis in Zimbabwe, has made access to cash to buy the pesticides recommended by agriculture extension officers very difficult."To spray an entire field is a challenge, the cheapest pesticide is $9/kg and some pesticides go up for as much as $65/kg. Imagine how much you will need to spend to spray your whole farm," she said.While the region and farmers count the cost of the fall armyworm outbreak, the damage inflicted has not been restricted to fields, but seems to have made its way into the corridors of power as well.The Democratic Alliance's shadow agriculture minister, Annette Steyn, has accused the government of being asleep at the wheel, right until fall armyworm had made its way into South Africa. "The lethargic response to what should be considered a very grave crisis is deserving of strong condemnation," she said.The department had ignored a report released in October last year by the International Association for the Plant Protection Sciences, which confirmed the outbreak of the fall armyworm in Nigeria and warned that it could spread rapidly, Steyn said.rayzr21@gmail.com, biyasel@timesmedia.co.za
