Yorke, 45, a Trinidad and Tobago international, while travelling to the Caribbean, was refused permission to travel via Miami, an airport which acts as a gateway to much of the region.He obtained the Iranian visa after playing in a charity match in Iran in 2015.Details of the incident were disclosed by Richard Keys, a presenter on beIN Sports, who works alongside the retired player.Yorke, who was travelling on personal business, also acts as an ambassador for Manchester United.He had also been a pundit providing co-commentary on Manchester United's Europa League tie on Thursday night against St Etienne."I couldn't quite believe what was happening. I have lost count of the number of times I have been to America, I love the country, yet I was being made to feel like a criminal," Yorke told the Sun"I had bought my ticket and checked in and was about to get on the flight when I was stopped by two officials."I thought 'what is happening here?'. They told me there was a visa problem and a red flag had come up against my name because of an Iranian stamp in my passport."The incident came as controversy continued to rage at the entry ban imposed on citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries by US President Donald Trump, which was suspended by the courts last week.However, on this occasion, Yorke appears to have been caught by a regulation introduced by the Obama administration.It ruled that anyone who had visited Iran - along with Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Libya, Yemen or Sudan - were no longer allowed to use the visa waiver programme.Anyone with an offending stamp in their passport is required to obtain a visa from a US embassy before attempting to enter the country.
