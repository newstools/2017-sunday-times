GOING DOWNTOWNIt all started with a beer in the Main Bar at the Rand Club (33 Loveday Street) with Joburg architect Brian McKechnie.One of the forces of Joburg's inner-city regeneration, McKechnie led me on a whistlestop tour of some of its finest buildings, including Anstey's on Joubert Street, the art-deco beauty with some of the best apartments in the universe. Saddle up: this book's your definitive guide to SA's best mountain bike trailsALL ALONG MAIN STREETSuitably calibrated, I hopped on my hipster bike and cranked down Main Street which, since it's largely pedestrianised and has been planted with trees, is a proper green lung with no car-clamour.Its attractions include a proper mine headgear - an iconic (and sadly rare) sight these days in the former eGoli - the glorious leaping impala statue outside the Anglo American campus, and wonderful mosaics of Joburg life by Marco Cianfanelli, which add stripes of colour to a square on the street.Plus there are the monolithic Anglo buildings themselves, which, if you like that sort of thing, are worth going a long way to see.DIAGONAL STREET AND CHANCELLOR HOUSEAfter Main Street's seductive calm, I had a few hairy moments in the traffic on my way to Diagonal Street.After a nod to No. 11, the glass "diamond" building where I once worked, I took a slow amble down President Street, where there are still general dealers selling anything from tin-plate candesticks to blankets to fine brogue shoes, all things I have coveted in my life.Then a block or two south to Chancellor House (corner Fox and Gerard Sekoto streets), once home to Mandela and Tambo Attorneys with its window-display museum of the life of Nelson Mandela.By now the promised thunderstorm had broken.More streets for another day, then. If biking Joburg's streets is not your cup of tea, take a walking tour instead. Two great operators are MainStreetWalks and Past Experiences.
