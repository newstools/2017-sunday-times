Q: We are a lesbian couple and I am concerned that every time my girlfriend and I are intimate, she bleeds. What could be the cause of that?A: It is not uncommon for people to experience spotting after penetrative sex. The possible reasons vary in seriousness and sometimes the cause may be a result of a serious medical condition.Bleeding may arise from the vulva, urethral opening, vaginal opening, labia, clitoris and even the cervix. Some of the causes may include vaginal dryness, atrophy due to lack of oestrogen as often seen in menopause, and injury to the vaginal wall due to inadequate lubrication or foreplay.Sex Talk: How can I permanently put an end to vaginal itching? As many people have become more inquisitive and are using different sex toys, it is important to remember to use toy-friendly lubricants.Genital infections and inflammation of the cervix require medical treatment and viral lesions such as those caused by herpes may linger for a long time and may require suppression therapy.Consult your doctor for a genital and vaginal check as well as screening tests such as pap smears and vaginal swabs.Some solutions may be simple and relatively inexpensive, such as using a water-based lubricant regularly or regular replacement of your sex toys often the silicone may experience wear and tear.For post-menopausal women who have vaginal atrophy, topical vaginal creams may be appropriate; however, you must check with your doctor to make sure you are a good candidate.
