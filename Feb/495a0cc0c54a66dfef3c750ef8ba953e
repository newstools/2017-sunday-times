The 2.4m wall will cost around 20-million (about R284-million) and will replace temporary metal barriers set up during the Euro 2016 football tournament last year.It is intended to prevent attackers or vehicles storming the tourist landmark, which is visited by seven million people each year."We have three aims: improve the look, make access easier and strengthen the protection of visitors and staff," said deputy mayor Jean-Fran ois Martins.Eiffel Tower to be enclosed by bulletproof, glass wallVisitors used to be able to walk freely under the tower until the temporary barriers were put up, and the glass wall will mean that free access to that space will be permanently removed. Visitors who want access to the site will need to pass a security checkpoint.Martins said the glass wall was part of a 15-year, 300-million overhaul of the tower. It includes a complete reorganisation of the space directly under the tower and the surrounding park, maintenance work and a plan to reduce time spent queueing.Officials insist the wall will be in harmony with the tower and will not make it look like a fortress. The idea was to build a "permanent and aesthetic barrier", said Martins. "Unfortunately, the risk of terrorism has not gone away."Work is due to start late this year, although the plan must be approved by a historic sites commission and then by the environment ministry.France has been on a high terror alert for two years after several deadly jihadist attacks in Paris.
