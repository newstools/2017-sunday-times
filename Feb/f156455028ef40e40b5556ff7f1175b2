Boje was part of the only South African side to win a test series in India, at the turn of the millennium.Installed as the Knights' permanent coach after holding the position in an interim capacity after Sarel Cilliers's contract was not renewed in 2015, the Free State franchise won the Sunfoil Series for the first time since the 2007/08 season.Prince tried to ward off the might of the Australian juggernaut in 2001/02 and failed as South Africa stumbled to what still is their worst test defeat - an innings and 360 runs at the Wanderers in Johannesburg. Tsunami on the horizonAt the start of the year, the Cape Cobras were down and out after the first round of the Sunfoil Series, having lost three of their first five matches.The team was knee-deep in a revolt against former Proteas spinner Paul Adams which went as far as a case being lodged with the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration.Prince was the assistant coach at the time, but with the upturn of the team's fortunes this year, it points to him being far removed from the parapet.They finished third on the log without dropping a game this year.The 66-test veteran said the senior players led the way and made the transition easy for him.He was typecast as undeserving of the head coaching role because of his lack of qualifications."There will always be question marks around people like myself and Mark Boucher because of our lack of coaching qualifications," Prince said."We know we have to attend those courses in the winter when the chance arises but I feel there's a place for [a] coach with vast first-class and international experience like Boucher and myself. The qualifications are important and we're looking forward to undertaking those qualifications."Look at Nicky Boje and how he won the Sunfoil Series, he's also a coach with plenty of first-class and international experience as a player. There must be places for people like us but I can understand when we're asked to do our Level Three and Level Four qualifications. It shouldn't just be about the years we've had as players."Boje had things a bit easier in Bloemfontein even though his interim tenure wasn't the best in the aftermath of Cilliers's abrupt departure.Having been part of Knights' teams who were successful when they traded under the name of the Eagles/Diamond Eagles at the start of the franchise era, Boje knew what success tasted like. He also credited the small nature of Bloemfontein as one of the reasons for their four-day conquest."Bloemfontein is a bit of a small place and the guys do get quite close together. It almost feels like a family," Boje said."That's one of the main aspects of playing for a central franchise and that's a nice thing. The win was an unbelievable achievement for everyone involved."
