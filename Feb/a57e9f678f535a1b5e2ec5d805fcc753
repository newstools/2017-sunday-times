In just 12 months he has been part of a revolution of sorts and remodelled a side that many had written off before arriving at the tournament.And now, the former Belgian World Cup star is looking to win a tournament not many had even dreamed was possible."We want to go into this final and win it. For these young players - 14 of the 23 are playing at their first Cup of Nations - it is possibly a unique opportunity in their careers to win the trophy," he said. "There will be enough motivation and inspiration to make sure we are ready." Cameroon battle their demons"This team came here and nobody believed in them. If you told someone before the tournament we would get to the final they would have laughed," said Broos.The 64-year-old Belgian has turned around the fortunes of a country that had been a disgrace at the 2014 World Cup and were knocked out of the 2015 Cup of Nations in the first round.Those poor performances eventually led to the sacking of German Volker Finke, and Broos was named as his replacement in February last year. A former Belgian international who had enjoyed much success as a coach in his homeland, Broos had then worked in Greece, Turkey, the Gulf and Algeria, but had never managed a national team.Yet he applied for the vacancy when it was advertised by the Cameroonian federation, convinced that he met the numerous demands, including having an extensive list of honours won as a player or coach, not to mention a good knowledge of Powerpoint.Under his stewardship, the Indomitable Lions, for so long the leading force on the continent, have lost just once. That defeat was a 3-2 friendly loss away to France last May. His players are glowing in their praise of Broos, citing improved discipline and a feeling of squad unity that had not been there previously. He has even spoken out in their defence amid a row over bonus payments.
