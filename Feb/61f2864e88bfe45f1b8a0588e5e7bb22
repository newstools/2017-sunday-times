After a combative press conference on Thursday, in which he railed at "fake news", bullied reporters and dismissed facts, the US president used Twitter on Friday to continue his assault on the press: "The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!"The phrase "enemy of the people" goes as far back as the Roman Empire, but Russia's Joseph Stalin and Mao are among the leaders to have made it infamous in more modern history."Charming that our uneducated president manages to channel the words of Stalin and fails to hear the historical resonance of this phrase," tweeted Mitchell Orenstein, professor of Russian and East European studies at the University of Pennsylvania."What it basically meant was a death sentence," he told Voice of America.
