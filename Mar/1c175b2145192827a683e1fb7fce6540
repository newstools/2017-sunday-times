In reply to written questions in parliament, Nkwinti said he wanted the probe to date back to 1994.The Sunday Times reported last month that Nkwinti introduced a Luthuli House comrade who was "shopping" for a Limpopo farm to one of his top officials at a land summit. Eight months later, Bekendvlei Farm was bought for R97-million and handed over to Errol Velile Present, a long-serving Luthuli House official, and his partner, businessman Moses Boshomane, to manage. Nkwinti was a speaker at Present's wedding a day after the deal went through.Minister helped friends take over R97m farm"No, I do not intend to resign," said Nkwinti in his response to the question from EFF MP Reneilwe Mashabela. Nkwinti said he had already referred the matter to the public protector for investigation.Nkwinti's chief of staff, Errol Heynes, said the audit was a direct response to the allegations. "This comes about as a result of that accusation which appeared in your newspaper. He's saying: 'I'm opening up to a lifestyle audit, then let's see who's talking the truth.'"Mashabela also asked Nkwinti whether he had done an audit of all farms handed over through the state's land acquisition programmes, to verify there was no corruption. "Yes. In the 2011-12 financial year, I requested the president to issue a proclamation to authorise the Special Investigating Unit to investigate allegations of theft, fraud, corruption and maladministration in relation to the land reform programme of the department," said Nkwinti. These investigations were ongoing. "As a result ... several farms have been seized by the Asset Forfeiture Unit," said Nkwinti. In November, 29 farms in the Eastern Cape, Free State and KwaZulu-Natal were handed back to the department.
