The volcano, one of the most active in the world, has been largely dormant for the last two years, but it sprung to life with bright orange lava spewing out high over the Mediterranean Island, eventually easing off by Tuesday morning. Catania airport, situated within 50 km of the volcano, remained open, but authorities were tracking the movements of the ash cloud.Etna, at 3,330 metres, is the highest volcano in mainland Europe and can burst into action several times a year. The last major eruption was in 1992.</img>Italy's Mount Etna, Europe's tallest and most active volcano, spews lava as it erupts on the southern island of Sicily, Italy.
