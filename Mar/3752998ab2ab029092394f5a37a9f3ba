According to Virgin Active's latest research, many women between the ages of 25 and 34 would rather look slim and toned in their holiday photos than be fit enough to run a marathon.Those under 25 claimed that ''looking good" was the main reason they worked out. It's not until we hit our mid 30s that most of us are motivated to hit the gym for our health.Not just for kids: trampolining is a fun new way to workoutThose over 55 tend to spend more time working up a sweat, but it's not just about the amount of time spent in the gym. Too many focus on one type of exercise, such as a weekly run or spin class, rather than having a varied exercise routine that covers strength, stamina and mobility."Exercise won't just help keep you slim, it's an important step to fight the effect of ageing and improve your mental and physical strength," says fitness expert Tim Wright, whose Beyond Movement programme incorporates Pilates, massage and physiotherapy.But just how ''fit" should we be at our age? Wright has devised a checklist for each generation: Run 5km in 30 minutes Do 20 burpees in a row Hold a full plank for one minute Run 1.6km in less than nine minutes Hold a plank for 45 seconds Dead-lift more than 50% of your body-weight Sprint for 60 seconds without stopping Do 10 press-ups without stopping Touch your toes comfortably with straight legs Run at a moderate pace for 60 seconds without stopping Do five burpees without stopping Lower yourself into a cross-legged position on the floor without using your hands, and then return to standingChannel your inner rock star & drum your way to fitness Regularly take more than 10,000 steps in a day Do 12 body-weight squats without stopping Touch your fingertips with one hand over your shoulder and the other behind your back Walk 1.6km in less than 16 minutes Climb a flight of stairs with 10 steps in under 30 seconds comfortably Rise to stand from a chair without using your hands or arms, and repeat at least 12 times in 30 seconds.- The Daily Telegraph
