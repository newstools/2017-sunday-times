Cricket SA (CSA) falls into the former category, even though their cash reserves mean they could sustain themselves for a good three to four years.Those cash reserves are always considerably swelled when Indian cricket is involved, hence the importance of the 39% interest emanating from India for the planned Global Domestic League (GDL).When the Indian Premier League (IPL) and a full India tour took place in 2009/10 and 2010/11, CSA had before-tax profits of R138.8-million and R247.1-million.CSA chief executive Haroon Lorgat knows how important Indian participation in the GDL is the Indian market laps up South African-based cricket because of the favourable time zone."No doubt the time zone and our hosting capabilities are plus points but there are also great relations between the people of our countries. Perhaps of even greater relevance is the huge fan base South African cricket legends have in India. Corporates have their own strategies and Indian companies are following natural growth paths by seeking opportunities abroad. It also seems like South African cricket is appealing to them," Lorgat said. CSA brings T20 in from the cold, but beware the Indians"We were very encouraged rather than surprised by the number of Expressions of Interest received from India."We believed from the onset that a T20 League in South Africa has real value and that we can design a world-class product that will draw world-wide interest."If there are hindrances out of CSA's control, it is whether there will be Indian players involved in the tournament, especially with India tentatively set to tour South Africa at the end of the year.There is also the big issue of the BCCI not allowing players to take part in other Twenty20 tournaments except for the IPL, which starts next month.What could make CSA's life easier is that India do not have a set home season, an example being the current 2016/17 season where they have played 13 home tests against New Zealand, England, Bangladesh and Australia from October until the end of this month.In other years, India have not been busy at home at that time of the year, which also helps CSA's cause because of the tournament set to run from November until December 16.While other tournaments like the Big Bash League and Caribbean Premier League having success without the marquee Indian players, Lorgat knows there's a recipe to success without them. Lorgat said the BCCI will not have a say in the companies that show interest in the GDL."The schedule for the GDL was built on what would work best for us in South Africa and is not related to when another member country has its home season," said Lorgat. "We want our fans to watch the best South African players together with any other international stars that would be available at that time."At present, the BCCI doesn't allow their players to participate in other leagues and we respect their position."We will engage with them to see what is possible in the future. Companies have their own boards who govern and direct their affairs. It would be each board of directors' decision to contract with CSA."India's scheduled tour of South Africa after the GDL does not seem to be in doubt but the current governance chaos at the BCCI is not making life easier for CSA.Lorgat seems confident that the series against Virat Kohli's side is going to happen despite dates not being announced.
