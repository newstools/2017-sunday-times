Leafy green vegetables, blueberries, strawberries and plant proteins such as lentils and beans top the menu recommended by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine.The doctors say a whole-food, plant-based diet lowers blood pressure, stabilises blood sugar and breaks down the arterial plaque that leads to heart disease. And the recommended foods should be consumed whole, rather than juiced or processed into supplements. Experts warn of all sugar's hiding placesNutrition researcher Neal Barnard led a team of 12 who reviewed the latest research to devise a food "prescription" that doctors can use as a quick guide for patients. Their findings will be published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology on Tuesday. They say olive oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, and nuts provide healthy sources of "good" fats, but should be eaten in moderation due to their high calorie content. A diet rich in added fats, fried food, eggs, organ and processed meats, and sugar-sweetened beverages, as well as coconut oil and palm oil, should be avoided. Gluten-containing foods should be avoided only if patients have sensitivities or allergies. Said Barnard: "It's no surprise people are confused about what constitutes a heart-healthful diet. With thousands of studies published each year, we get contradictory headlines. We collaborated on this review to provide a real-time prescription based on the best available peer-reviewed research."South Africa has one of the world's highest rates of cardiovascular disease, and the World Heart Federation says a diet that includes too much fat, sugar and salt and too few fruits and vegetables is to blame.
