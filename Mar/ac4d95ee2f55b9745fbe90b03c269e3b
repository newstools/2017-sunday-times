Simbine scorched the Tuks track in 9.93sec - even faster than the 9.94 he clocked finishing fifth at the Rio Olympics last year - in his season-opener at a Gauteng North league meet.Later, in the 200m, he went 19.95 to become only the third local sprinter to break the 20second barrier, after Wayde van Niekerk and Anaso Jobodwana, owner of the 19.87 SA record.Athletics SA must surely realise now they erred overlooking Simbine for the 200m in Brazil last year, a mistake that probably cost SA a medal."I've done something I said I could do last year," said a chuffed Simbine, 23. "I've proven to everyone and myself that I'm a sub-20 runner."We didn't plan on running the 200m [today]," he added. "We felt after the hundred, the body's good, the weather's good ..."Clarence Munyai, 19, led Simbine for the first 150m and finished second in a 20.10 junior African record.Behind them both, fourth-placed LJ van Zyl got a little distracted watching them slug it out. "I thought, 'flip, those guys are moving now' and I watched the clock - 18, 19, dip."
