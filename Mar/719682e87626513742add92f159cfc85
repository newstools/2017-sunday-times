Trailing 20-7 at half-time, the 'Saders scored 15 unanswered points in the second half, despite playing the final 10 minutes with only 14 men after Jordan Taufua was shown a yellow card for foul play.It was the Crusaders' second comeback win in succession and follows their 30-27 victory over the Highlanders last weekend."I am really proud that even though we were down a few points we came back," said Crusaders captain Sam Whitelock. Gritty Highlanders keep the Blues at bay"It would be nice not to do that - it would be nice to get a few points early."Reds, the rank outsiders going into the match, started strongly and opened the scoring with an early Quade Cooper penalty.Cooper, who was involved in almost all of the Queensland side's attacks, had the home fans worried when he needed treatment on his left leg but he was able to carry on.However, the 'Saders were not so lucky when All Blacks fullback Israel Dagg went down clutching his right knee and had to be replaced after 10 minutes.Soon after Dagg left the field, the Reds scored the opening try when Sami Kerevi steamed onto a short ball from Cooper and ran over the top of Jack Goodhue.Cooper's conversion gave the home side a surprising 10-0 lead after only 10 minutes.The Reds went further ahead when hooker Stephen Moore threw a superb pass to Kerevi, who burst through the Crusaders defence before finding winger Eto Nabuli, who crossed untouched to give the home side a 17-0 lead.The Crusaders finally got on the scoreboard when former Reds winger Digby Ioane kicked ahead for scrumhalf Mitchell Drummond to score his seventh Super Rugby try.Hunt's conversion made it 17-7 to the hosts but a second Cooper penalty gave the Reds a 20-7 lead at half time.The Crusaders finally broke through midway through the second period, Hunt breaking the line and feeding Michael McKenzie, who found Brynn Hall to score out wide and make it 20-12.Hall scored his second with three minutes left when he crashed over under the posts.The Reds tried desperately to hold on but when Kerevi was penalised for going off his feet in a ruck, Hunt stepped up to give the visitors the win.
