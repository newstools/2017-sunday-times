She is fighting her addiction to fast food and sugar with a stringent diet and exercise regime ordered by her doctor.The Grade 4 Durban pupil is not alone in her battle against the bulge - thousands of South African children are either overweight or obese due to bad eating habits.On the back of a new Harvard study into the diets of US kids, South African nutritionists have warned that fast food could be fuelling the country's childhood obesity problem and could lead to cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, diabetes, cancer and fatty liver disease. Fast-food outlets strive to improve nutritional content of children's menusAccording to local dietitians,a cheese pizza and a milkshake from Spur would account for almost all the fat, salt and protein, and double the sugar, regarded as an appropriate daily amount for a child aged between seven and 10.A McDonald's Happy Meal cheeseburger contained all the fat, more than half the energy and carbs, more than 80% of the salt and twice the sugar recommended as the daily limit for children aged four to six.The outlets examined - including Wimpy, Spur, McDonald's, KFC and Panarottis - have defended their kids' menus, saying they have made efforts to offer healthier meals.Dietitians rating healthy options for children gave the thumbs-up to two Wimpy dishes - grilled chicken breast with salad, and fish fingers with salad - and one from Nando's, chicken strips, corn and salad.The latest National Health and Nutrition Survey carried out by the Human Sciences Research Council shows that 13.5% of South African children aged six to 14 are overweight or obese, compared with the global average of 10%.Durban paediatrician Dr Monica Vaithilingum said doctors were seeing an increase in childhood weight issues caused by eating convenience foods and not getting enough exercise.Vaithilingum advised parents to cut back on processed foods, takeaways and sugar.She said that when parents planned meals for their kids they should take into account family history and any genetic predisposition towards diseases such as diabetes and hypertension.Local dietitians say that in most cases, there is a correlation between eating restaurant food and consuming more sugar, salt and saturated fats.They found that many kids'-meal options surpassed the recommended daily allowance for children between four and 12. For salt the amount is from half to three-quarters of a teaspoon, and for sugar it is from three to five teaspoons. Dietitian Phillipa Bredenkamp of Mindful Eating said: "Looking at some of the kids' menus at takeaway restaurants, we can see why there is such an obesity epidemic, as many of the foods are high fat and high sugar."While a parent might think giving a child a milkshake as a treat would not do any harm, "the kiddies' milkshakes contain anywhere from seven to 13 teaspoons of sugar".Nutritionist Desi Horsman said many restaurants focused on foods they knew kids would eat.She said it was worrying that parents found kids' menus acceptable, and that things like fish fingers and chicken nuggets were what kids ate at home too.Vanessa Kotze, a lecturer in the University of Pretoria's faculty of health sciences, said most fast-food chains did offer alternatives."Stick to smaller portions," she said. "With the meal options one can consume up to half a teaspoon of salt and six teaspoons of sugar, as well as saturated fat."Do not choose fried meals, select grilled. People need to be aware of what they eat and make informed choices."Taylor's mother said her daughter was so addicted to sugar that she even had an affinity for medications that were sweet. She said most kids' menus did not offer appealing healthy options. "Spinach and butternut are boring side dishes and because they are mass produced are not very tasty. So if a child is having a burger they would rather ask for chips. We all eat with our eyes."* Not her real name Experts warn of all sugar's hiding places Sugar addiction is one of the biggest contributors to obesity in children, say nutritional experts.The government is trying to tackle it with a sugar tax. According to the Healthy Active Kids South Africa report card in 2014, children are typically consuming 50g of sugar a day and teenagers 100g a day."Sugar-sweetened beverages are a major contributor to this high sugar intake," the report said. It said two out of three school-going children bought these beverages at least twice a week.Zelda Ackerman, spokeswoman for the Association for Dietetics in South Africa, said research showed one or more sweetened drinks a day would cause a 26% greater risk of Type 2 diabetes.Nutritionist Desi Horsman said sugar consumption - which included refined carbohydrates - affected dopamine and opioid neurotransmission, which led "to strong impulses to eat more food than is needed".She added: "While a tax levy might have some effect on decreasing consumption of sugar in soft drinks, it is only the tip of the battle."For a long-term effect, heavily processed foods loaded with added sugar, fat and salt - such as fast foods and their accompanying sauces, crisps, biscuits, pastries, sweets, chocolates and cereals - should be radically reduced."Ice teas, vitamin water and flavoured waters have more sugar than imaginable," said Horsman.pillayt@sundaytimes.co.za and govendersu@sundaytimes.co.za
