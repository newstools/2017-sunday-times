Word doing the rounds before the match in Polokwane was that Zion Christian Church bishops visited Baroka's training ground this week to pray for the club to avoid relegation.The home side may have failed to win meaning they have now gone 16 league matches without victory but they will take comfort from their fightback and hope the prayers will be answered come the end of this season.Amakhosi, on the other hand, missed out on moving up the log table after dropping two points despite getting their noses in front twice. They remain fourth. Citizens, Siwelele in dull stalemate on poor pitch Chiefs wouldn't have asked for a better start after taking the lead through centre-back Erick Mathoho inside six minutes. Playing in his home province, Limpopo, the Bafana Bafana defender had the simplest of tap-ins from a cross by Bernard Parker.There was a quick reply from Bakgaka when defender Victor Letsoalo levelled matters four minutes later.The defender's effort came off the underside of the crossbar and for a moment, everyone was left confusedas to whether it was a goal or not. Top referee Victor Gomes eventually decided to award the goal and replays show it was the correct decision.It was a fast-paced match, but one that had few chances after the goals early on. Chiefs, however, did finish the stronger side in the first half.Baroka were caught defending like amateurs on the stroke of half time and whether it was a penalty or not, Gomes decided captain Oleleng Shaku had made a foul while on the ground and pointed to the penalty spot.Despite Baroka's protests, Parker stepped up and converted to restore Chiefs' lead heading into the break.Chiefs continued to press on after the break, but Siphiwe Tshabalala's shot from distance was nowhere close to hitting the target in the 48th minute.The two sides started making changes as they looked to improve their play and for Baroka, Mxolisi Kunene's introduction for Letsoalo on the hour mark proved vital.With 10 minutes remaining, Kunene took matters into his own hands. From near the centre line, the left-winger made a run for it and with Chiefs defenders ball watching, he went on to get the equaliser when he beat goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune from close range.
