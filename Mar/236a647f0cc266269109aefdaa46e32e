The breakthrough could allow doctors to diagnose specific cancers much earlier, even before signs such as a lump begin to show.It is simple enough to be included in routine annual health checks alongside other tests such as for high blood pressure or cholesterol.The test, called CancerLocator, has been developed by the University of California at Los Angeles, and works by hunting for the DNA from tumours which circulates in the blood of cancer patients.Taking the pill can protect women from certain cancers for up to 30 yearsThe team discovered that tumours which arise in different parts of the body have a distinctive "molecular footprint" which a computer can spot.They also compiled a footprint for non-cancerous samples, which can be used to give patients the all-clear."Non-invasive diagnosis of cancer is important, as it allows the early diagnosis of cancer, and the earlier the cancer is caught, the higher chance a patient has of beating the disease," said Professor Jasmine Zhou, the co-lead author."We have developed a computer-driven test that can detect cancer, and identify the type of cancer, from a single blood sample."The technology is in its infancy and requires further validation, but the potential benefits to patients are huge."About 90% of people will survive most types of cancer for at least five years if it is spotted early. Only 5% to 15% of people survive for five years if cancer is picked up late.The test was checked 10 times on blood samples from 29 liver cancer patients, 12 lung cancer patients and five breast cancer patients. It picked up eight out of 10 cancers, and gave a false positive on fewer than one in 100 occasions. Warning signs 1) Any sudden weight loss when not dieting;2) Blood in your faeces or urine;3) Coughing up blood;4) A lump in the breast, groin, testes, side of the neck or armpit; and5) Severe, unexplained pains or aches.
