Makes: 12-14Ingredients:480g (4 cups) cake flourPinch of salt30ml (2 tbsp) baking powder125g butter, cubed85ml ( cup) sugar250ml (1 cup) buttermilk1 extra-large egg60-80ml water, as neededBeaten egg, for glazingTopping:Butter and/or whipped creamJam of your choiceMethod:1) Sift the flour, salt and baking powder into a large bowl. Lightly rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Mix in the sugar.2) In a separate bowl, combine the buttermilk and egg and, using a round-bladed knife, stir this into the flour mixture with enough water to make a soft but not too sticky dough. The dough should come together and leave the sides of the bowl clean.3) Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead very lightly until it forms a ball. 4) Using lightly floured fingers, pat the dough down to about 3cm thick. Cut out scones using a 7cm-diameter cutter and place on a greased or sprayed baking sheet. 5) Lightly knead together the trimmings and cut out a last scone. 6) Brush each scone with a little beaten egg and bake in a preheated oven at 220 C for 12-15 minutes. Allow to cool and serves with butter, cream or jam or a combination of these, or all three.
