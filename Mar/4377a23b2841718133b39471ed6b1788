The government is trying to tackle it with a sugar tax. According to the Healthy Active Kids South Africa report card in 2014, children are typically consuming 50g of sugar a day and teenagers 100g a day."Sugar-sweetened beverages are a major contributor to this high sugar intake," the report said. It said two out of three school-going children bought these beverages at least twice a week.Zelda Ackerman, spokeswoman for the Association for Dietetics in South Africa, said research showed one or more sweetened drinks a day would cause a 26% greater risk of Type 2 diabetes.Nutritionist Desi Horsman said sugar consumption - which included refined carbohydrates - affected dopamine and opioid neurotransmission, which led "to strong impulses to eat more food than is needed".She added: "While a tax levy might have some effect on decreasing consumption of sugar in soft drinks, it is only the tip of the battle."For a long-term effect, heavily processed foods loaded with added sugar, fat and salt - such as fast foods and their accompanying sauces, crisps, biscuits, pastries, sweets, chocolates and cereals - should be radically reduced."Ice teas, vitamin water and flavoured waters have more sugar than imaginable," said Horsman.
