 But the South Africans, who qualified for the play-offs with this victory, needed to pick up their game in the second half.It was only in the final quarter that the Stormers found their rhythm. By then they were trailing 31-20, but proceeded to score 24 unanswered points that made the victory appear more convincing that it really was.Both teams had travelled to the venue for this game, and by the end it seemed that the Sunwolves suffered more from jetlag. Lions patient on top oke AckersA week ago the Sunwolves had lost to the Bulls in Pretoria while the Stormers could relax with a bye. The difference showed in the last 20 minutes yesterday.The Sunwolves began with a flourish, and played a high-risk game that appeared to pay off, until near the final whistle.Before they ran out of gas, however, the Sunwolves were full value. Centre Derek Carpenter scored after only five minutes, but they only missed an earlier try because of a poor pass.It was the Sunwolves' fifth straight defeat of the season and it will only get harder. This week they are at home in Japan against the Bulls and will have a chance for revenge. But the week after it gets harder as the Japan-based team heads for New Zealand with a first-up match against the Crusaders.For the Stormers, yesterday's game was a big wake-up call ahead of their home match at Newlands this weekend against the Cheetahs. After that they take the arduous journey to New Zealand for matches against the Chiefs, Highlanders and Hurricanes.In fairness to the Stormers, they struggled in the humidity. But once they tightened up and took control of set pieces and rolling mauls they looked far more convincing.SCORERSSunwolves 31 Tries: Derek Carpenter (2), Shota Emi, Liaki Moli.
