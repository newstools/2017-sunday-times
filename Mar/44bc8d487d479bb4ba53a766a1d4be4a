In his post-match interviews after the 1-0 win over Rostov, Mourinho vented his fury at United's fixture pile-up, stating the club had "lots of enemies" as he lost Paul Pogba to injury as his side completed their third match in a week.Mourinho also made the claim that United will "probably lose on Sunday [today]" away at Middlesbrough, saying: "We played 11 matches in the last six weeks and it's going to get worse and it's going to get easier for the other teams. I think they [the EPL authorities] don't give an 's' [s***] about the English teams in the Europa."In an astonishing attack, Keane claimed Mourinho was talking "absolute nonsense" and suggested United could have played the reserves against Rostov as they won their Europa League last-16 tie 2-1 on aggregate."I've never heard so much rubbish in my life why do we have to listen to that garbage? It's just utter nonsense, what he's talking about," said Keane."He's manager of Manchester United, one of the biggest clubs on the planet the squad he's got, the players, and he keeps moaning about fixtures and fatigue."We were looking at some of the cup draws they have had. They have had an easy ride in the cups, a lot of good draws, a lot of home draws."Keane added: "The guy is talking absolute nonsense. I never heard such rubbish in all my life."Maybe the club is too big for him. He can't deal with all these demands of the match what matches? Cup competitions? Man United reserves could have won that game tonight [on Thursday]."
