Topping the list of regulations is the introduction of plain packaging to reduce brand appeal.South Africa is following in the footsteps of countries such as Norway, France, Australia and Belgium that have either implemented or announced their intention to introduce cigarette packs devoid of logos or colour."The regulations to deal with the harmful effects of tobacco are being finalised and we will announce them as soon as we are ready,'' said Joe Maila, health ministry spokesman."We want to make it clear to South Africans that we are determined to strengthen the law in order to deal with the harmful effects of tobacco effectively." Smokers are the new lepers - but they need some love too Both the Cancer Association of South Africa and the National Council Against Smoking are supporting the government's push to introduce standardised packs."Plain packaging is an important demand-reduction measure; it reduces the attractiveness of tobacco products, restricts the use of tobacco packaging to be used as a form of advertising and limits misleading packaging and labelling," said Magdalene Seguin, head of advocacy at Cansa."Scientific evidence shows that plain packaging for tobacco products is effective in decreasing tobacco use."Dr Yussuf Saloojee, executive director of the National Council Against Smoking, said removing the attractive colours and logos from tobacco products reduced their appeal, especially among young people."In Australia, cigarette smoking has fallen to record low levels since the country introduced plain packing in 2012," said Saloojee.The council has urged the government to introduce the regulation to "reduce the 44,400 deaths caused by cigarette smoking every year in South Africa".UK medical journal The Lancet revealed this week that smoking globally has been reduced by 2.5%."The global tobacco control treaty has increased the adoption of tobacco reduction measures around the world," said The Lancet.Worldwide, 180 countries, including South Africa, have committed to implementing strong anti-smoking policies, including high taxes, smoke-free public spaces, warning labels, advertising bans and support for stop-smoking services.
