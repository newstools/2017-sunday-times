Being a tinderbox for fire is just one of a slate of problems they face.But who is to blame?Warren Smit, a researcher at the African Centre for Cities, said: "Informal settlements across the continent are caused by exclusionary planning and legal systems. South African cities are the most exclusionary in the world, so the disparities are particularly stark." Cape Town community rebuilds amid dust and ashesSouth Africa's upgrading of informal settlements programme was introduced in 2004, but, said Smit, "insufficient progress has been made".The alternative, relocation to new housing projects, can never be a solution."This is usually to peripheral locations and results in the disruption of social and economic networks," he said.Upgrading existing settlements with "clear re source allocations and time frames" is the answer.Axolile Notywala of the Social Justice Coalition said the biggest mistake being made by the government was its continuing treatment of informal settlements as "squatter and transit camps" . The government spent its time "wishing they would go away" instead of "investing in their infrastructure".The disaster at Imizamo Yethu is a microcosm of the country, he said: "This place was established over 15 years ago. People have lost their homes and belongings many times before to fires, and administration after administration turns a blind eye."He said apartheid had a role to play in spatial division, but "the spatial havoc we see today is as much a fault of the current government".Community leader Samkelo Krweqe said people who live in informal settlements "find themselves to be treated like intruders in the cities where they live".All over South Africa, as in Hout Bay, "you can see three groups - the stinking rich across the road, the extremely poor on the one side, and then those in the middle".But, he said, it was only when lives were lost that people were given what they needed."Is there any white South African who would go for 15 years without electricity, water, waste removal and services?" he asked.</img>Residents rebuild their homes on the slopes above Hout Bay after a fire ripped through Imizamo Yethu informal settlement.
