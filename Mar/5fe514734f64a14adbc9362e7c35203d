We like to think that whether you're a brand, an individual or an employee, we exist to help you find yours.Describe your brand in three words.Keep it simple.You recently started making furniture. Which is your favourite piece and why?The Roca Chair - it's a leather rocking chair that allows you to just sink in and drift off.How do you work on each piece?We start by asking a lot of questions as a group. This process is energetic and productive and leads to ideas we never expected. That's the easy part. The production side is all about collaboration and creating a network of trust. This allows us to focus on the design and the detail, the most important part of the process.How are the materials significant?We loved the simplicity of the original Roca sketch. Three or four lines creating an entire piece. We wanted to keep that simplicity so chose materials that allowed us to do that. They obviously needed to be comfortable and durable. We're hoping to spend a lot of time in there.</img>The Roca Chair by North Ltd. Image: Supplied The Roca Chair by North Ltd.
