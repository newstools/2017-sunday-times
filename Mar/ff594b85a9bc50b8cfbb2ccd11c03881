Television has been having a rather grand time of time travelling in recent years. Among other series, we've had the bodice-ripping Outlander, the adaptation of Stephen King's 11.22.63, the apocalyptic 12 Monkeys, and that perennial favourite and BBC classic, Dr Who.The latest batch of time-defiers comes courtesy of Travelers, now streaming on Netflix. This Canadian series has come up with a good concept: it's not people who arrive from a distant future in the present but something far more wispy and ethereal, their consciousnesses.Series review: 'Frontier' is a wonderful exercise in gory escapismA bunch of them arrive from a few hundred years in the future on, natch, another mission to save humanity from itself. To do so, they take over the lives of a disparate inner-city bunch: male lead, FBI agent, Grant MacLaren, (Eric McCormack); Marcy, a learning-disabled library assistant (Mackenzie Porter); Marcy's social worker, David (Patrick Gilmore); a high school athlete, Trevor (Jared Paul Abrahamson); single mom Carly (Nesta Marlee Cooper); and heroin-addicted college student Philip (Reilly Dolman).That these "hosts" are not entirely reliable entities is part of the fun. Whatever is threatening our future is not spelt out in detail, but implied by certain, seemingly inconsequential events - the "travelers" savour certain common foodstuffs, for example, as if they've never tasted them before, and they don't exist in the future.When they're not receiving orders from the future and acting on them, the "travelers" have to blend into the pre-existing lives of their "hosts" to avoid suspicion.The heroin addict is one thing, but it gets fairly difficult for the social worker, David, especially when the once-barely verbal Marcy is now suddenly more intelligent and articulate than he is.Refreshingly, there's very little "science" here, and this intelligent, well-crafted and well-acted series champions humanity's better traits. The emphasis is on hope and action, rather than despair.The "fish out of water" elements are lightly comedic, and rather cleverly remind us of what we take for granted.When Grant complains that his job is "no walk in the park", he is told by Trevor: "Actually, you should try walking in the park sometime. It's lovely."WATCH the trailer for Travelers This article was originally published in The Times.
