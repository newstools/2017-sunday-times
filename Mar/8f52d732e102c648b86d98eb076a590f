Few of us might realise that being a rock drummer is a mental workout - with each hand following a different pattern, both sides of your brain have to operate swiftly and simultaneously.Add some physicality to it, and you've got a full body and mind workout. This was the idea behind the POUND workout created by Kirsten Potenza and Cristina Peerenboom, both recreational drummers and former athletes.Not just for kids: trampolining is a fun new way to workoutPotenza says when they began their first class in Los Angeles in 2011, they wanted an exercise that was going to put their passions together."We were forced to drum without a stool and squat over the drum kit, which is when we realised that drumming and exercise could be one and the same. We took a musical instrument and found a way to come up with an exercise and make it fun while being loud," she said."One of the benefits to the class is that with the sticks in your hands, instead of listening to music, you become the music."Potenza said the drum sticks help to distract you from all the squats and hand pumps, connecting you with the music."POUND is a place where the rhythm rules," she said.I tried a POUND class for 30 minutes and felt like I had run a 10km race. POUND classes will be available at selected Virgin Active Health Clubs.
