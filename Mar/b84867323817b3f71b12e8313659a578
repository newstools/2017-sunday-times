The party had just enjoyed a 2,000 banquet on Monday at the Hotel Carmen restaurant in Bembibre, northern Spain, before they did their dramatic runner."They were dancing, then suddenly they had disappeared," restaurant boss Antonio Rodriguez told Cadena Ser radio."In one minute, a hundred people had left. They didn't leave in little groups - no, they went all at once. Restaurant staff could not stop them," Rodriguez said."You can't do anything when there's so many of them."The Guardia civil police declined to confirm media reports that the fleeing diners were from eastern Europe, but an official in the force said they were not Spanish nationals."We know roughly where they are," said the official.
