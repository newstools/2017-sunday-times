Some have pointed to clips of the US president and first lady interacting awkwardly as evidence of their true feelings, while others have taken Melania's choice to not move into the White House immediately as proof that she is trying to avoid seeing her husband every day. The latter has officially been chalked up to their decision to have son Barron finish the school year in New York.But even Melania's scheduled move to Washington, DC, in June may result in the first couple keeping their distance. Sources told Us Weekly that the first couple did not sleep in the same bed.Multiple sources claim that the former fashion model - who is currently living 320km away from Washington in Trump Tower, New York - refuses to share a bed with Donald even on the rare occasions when they sleep in the same city. "They have separate bedrooms," said another Trump insider. "They never spend the night together - ever." A third source said the couple did sleep in the same room, but kept separate beds: "It's very 'royal' of them!"According to a 2016 GQ profile, "Melania has said the key to the success of her marriage is separate bathrooms". But in this case, maybe Donald just can't stop getting Lay's crumbs all over the sheets?
