The second-largest airport in the French capital was evacuated after the shooting and both terminals were closed, airport authorities said."A man took a weapon from a soldier, then hid in a shop in the airport before being shot dead by security forces," interior ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet said. No one was wounded in the incident. Interior Minister Bruno le Roux was due to visit the facility, on Paris's southern outskirts.Brandet said it had yet to be determined if the man had explosives on him. He said nearly 3000 people had been evacuated from the southern terminal but those in the other terminal had been "confined". Traffic to Orly had been "completely suspended", France's civil aviation authority said."We had queued up to check in for the Tel Aviv flight when we heard three or four shots nearby," a witness to the shooting, Franck Lecam, said.France is in a state of emergency after a series of terror attacks, including the November 2015 massacre in Paris and a truck attack in Nice in July last year. Last month, an Egyptian staged a machete attack at the Louvre museum before being shot and wounded.The latest shooting comes just weeks ahead of the first round of France's two-stage presidential election, in which security is one of the main issues on voters' minds.On Thursday, a letter bomb exploded at the Paris offices of the International Monetary Fund, injuring a secretary, who suffered burns.French President Fran ois Hollande said the IMF "attack" showed the country was "still targeted".
