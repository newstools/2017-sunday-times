Alex Younger, head of the Secret Intelligence Service as MI6 is officially known, told the Guardian this week he wanted to reach communities that were "selecting themselves out"."We have to go out and ask these people to join us," said Younger, who rarely makes public comments. "That was the only way of recruiting people, a tap on the shoulder. That was the way I was recruited," he said."We have to go to people that would not have thought of being recruited to MI6. We need to reflect the society we live in." In 2015, Britain said it would recruit 1,900 more spies to deal with Islamist militants.MI6 will launch a campaign to take its numbers to 3,500, the largest in its history. But it said it battled with the image that its officers were all like James Bond. "There is a perception out there that we want Daniel Craig, or Daniel Craig on steroids. He would not get into MI6," said MI6's female head of recruitment, who like all its agents apart from Younger, is anonymous."They may well be able to use a revolver. But that is not really what we are looking for."
