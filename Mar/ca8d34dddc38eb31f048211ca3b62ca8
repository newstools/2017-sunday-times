Q. My family and I will be travelling to Europe via Madrid in July.Will perishable food items that I purchase on my return (such as Iberian ham) pass through local customs without being confiscated?I am referring to items bought at the duty-free stores within the boarding-gate zone in Madrid. I have searched the SARS website and can't find answers. - Luiza de SousaA. Although airport shops may refuse to sell you alcohol if you're travelling to a country that does not allow any imports, they will probably not advise on food products and will sell you anything.Officially, you may not bring animal products, plants or seeds into the country, irrespective of where you bought them.
