After wins at home against the Bulls and Jaguares in their opening matches, the Stormers crossed the white line six times to show their intent this season.Their win also means that the Kings have yet to beat a local opposition in Super Rugby.The Kings were the first on the scoreboard after just five minutes when flyhalf Lionel Cronje nailed a penalty in front of an enthusiastic 15,000 spectators. But it was the visitors who registered the first five-pointer when wing Dillyn Leyds crossed the line in the 15th minute. Cheetahs run the Bulls raggedThe Kings had no answer to the Stormers' backline when they had the ball in hand and wing Bjorn Basson and flank Rynhardt Elstadt scored late first-half tries to give the visitors a healthy 17-3 half-time lead.The Stormers crashed the Kings defence whenever they attacked, and the latter were unable to stem the onslaught. Just four minutes after the restart, the Kings defence again buckled under pressure and Robert du Preez crashed over the line for his team's fourth try.The Kings scored their first try after 56 minutes when wing Makazole Mapimpi gathered a perfect cross-field kick from Cronje to power his way over the tryline. Cronje converted from the touchline, reducing the Stormers' lead to 24-10.After yesterday's setback, the Kings will be planning to get back to winning ways when they travel to Durban to play the Sharks on Saturday.SCORERSSouthern Kings 10 Tries: Makazole Mapimpi.
