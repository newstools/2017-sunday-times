Most recently the multimasking trend took over. This involves using a variety of masks all at once to treat different areas of concern - whether you need your nose decongested, your cheeks hydrated or your forehead brightened - all at the same time. Different mask technologies are now available, from bubble masks to sheet masks to goldinfused preparations. Here's a quick guide to work out which type of mask to use when.The ultimate face mask guide: Find the right one for your skinWhen you need to increase skin cell activityUse foam or bubble masks that fizz on the skin when exposed to oxygen. Some are infused with oxygen, which helps the skin's cell regeneration and delivery of active ingredients to the skin.Try: Exuviance Bionic Oxygen Facial, R940.When your skin needs a hydration boostApply a sheet mask for instant hydration and a targeted skin treatment. A cotton mask cut-out with a sticky side that is saturated in a hydrating serum-like solution, a sheet mask is easy to apply on the go. Opt for masks with gold as an ingredient to stimulate collagen production.Try: Theravine Ultravine Advanced Rejuvenating Gold Collagen Film, R282; GlamGlow Thirsty Mud Hydrating Treatment, R850.When you need to purify or have oily skinUse a detox mask to help combat the aging effects of pollution as well as strengthen the skin barrier to effectively protect the skin. Ingredients such as clay, mud and charcoal are popular in these masks for their ability to draw out impurities.Try: Est e Lauder Nightwear Plus 3 Minute Detox Mask 75ml, R650; Omorovicza Ultramoor Mud Mask 50ml, R1,813.
