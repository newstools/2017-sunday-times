This is according to a document prepared for discussion at the ANC's policy conference scheduled for June. If adopted, it becomes formal party policy.The document, drafted by the party's peace and stability subcommittee and signed off by the national executive committee, accuses unnamed foreign intelligence agencies of working with "negative domestic forces" to undermine the state.The document raises the possibility of the government being hijacked by "those with ulterior agendas, sectarian interests and nefarious intent". ANC pushes for its kind of judgesIt says: "The main strategy used by the foreign intelligence services is to mobilise the unsuspecting masses of this country to reject legally constituted structures and institutions in order to advance unconstitutional regime change."It reflects the views of ministers in President Jacob Zuma's security cluster, who have suggested protests like the #FeesMustFall campaign are funded and supported by foreign forces.Minister of State Security David Mahlobo has long expressed fears that foreign agencies are covertly working to destabilise the country by exploiting anti-government sentiment in local organisations, albeit sometimes without their knowledge. He told parliament last year that the media, NGOs, religious and student organisations were being used.The ANC says in its document that foreign spy agencies are using "a range of role players to promote their agenda and these include, but are not limited to: mass media, non-governmental organisations and community-based organisations, foreign and multinational companies, funding of opposition activities, judiciary, religion and student organisations".It accuses foreign agents of infiltrating key government departments, winning "prominent influential persons" over to their cause, and running spy networks in South Africa.Johan Burger of the Institute for Security Studies said there was no evidence to support the ANC's warnings."We haven't seen any proof that there is substance in these allegations or assumptions. We simply don't know if it is true or not," he said. Burger said weak governments tended to blame outsiders for their own inefficiencies."The weaker a government becomes, the more inclined it is to hide behind these suspicions about foreign threats."
