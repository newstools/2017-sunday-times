Fast forward two months and women have found a new way to project their views on Trump, this time using their hair.Hairdressers are reporting a sharp rise in tougher, blunter crops and shorter hairstyles as opposed to long locks and weaves, which some are attributing to the turbulent political times."Women are rebelling against traditional ideas of femininity and making personal and public statements with their hair. Stripping away the prettiness and embracing a tougher, bolder aesthetic," says Luke Hersheson, creative director with international haircare brand John Frieda. "It's an empowering look and publicly demonstrates that she's in control."Opinion: Help! I'm stuck in the super-expensive grooming cycle of a supermodelPerhaps it's Trump or maybe the ferocious fortitude of Claire Underwood (Robin Wright) in Netflix's hit series House of Cards, but this year US celebrities have gone short and blunt. Scarlett Johansson has a shaved crop, Kristen Stewart's gone for a platinum buzz cut and Rachel McAdams has adopted a choppy bob.All of the styles are the antithesis of the US first lady's long, smooth mane of hair that is always impressively groomed.This isn't just a sentiment among women in Hollywood. "We're seeing so many shorter, stronger haircuts and colours, like supermodel Linda Evangelista has always worn her hair," says hairstylist Adam Reed.Those who dismiss the idea of women making a stand with their hair as ridiculous should note that there's a well-documented history of shorter hairstyles in times of political uncertainty. This particular trend is being called the anti-Trump cut. - The Daily Telegraph This article was originally published in The Times.
