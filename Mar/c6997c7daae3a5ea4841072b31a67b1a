Their study involved 264 people with high blood pressure and an average age of 58.The subjects' average blood pressure began at around 140/90mmHg (millimetres of mercury), meaning they had what is clinically known as stage 1 hypertension.Most were already taking at least one drug to cut their blood pressure. Patients enrolled through the website of the Heart and Stroke Association of Canada and were randomly assigned to either an e-counselling group or a control group.

That was a statistically significant difference compared with the control group, which saw a 6mmHg reduction."The electronic counselling intervention had an effect similar to that of adding an additional blood-pressure-lowering medication," said lead study author Robert Nolan of the University of Toronto. "We think this lifestyle counselling intervention can complement and optimise the effectiveness of medical therapy to reduce high blood pressure."
