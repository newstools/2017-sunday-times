It should come as no surprise that President Jacob Zuma would spring to the spirited defence of his embattled social development minister, Bathabile Dlamini.Some 8,500km away in Jakarta, Indonesia, Zuma could hear the roar of the growing public demand this week that the minister be fired for putting the livelihoods of 10.6million grant recipients at risk.But he did not budge.

The current contract expires on March 31."People are going ahead and talking about the date," complained Zuma. "Others are calling for the minister to be fired, but the date has not come."It is somewhat worrying that people have preconceived ideas. Calm down and wait for the 1st [of April] ... It cannot be that on the 1st pensioners won't get their pay."The country must not take this matter as if a problem has arisen," he said, in what is typical of his approach to crisis situations.It is not surprising. As a compromised leader who has been found by the highest court in the land to have flouted the constitution, the president has no moral standing from which to chastise his minister for effectively circumventing a Constitutional Court ruling.It is unsurprising also because of the strong political bond that has developed between Zuma and Dlamini over the years especially in the past decade.They did not always see eye to eye, even though they may both call Nkandla home, Dlamini having lived in the now notorious rural KwaZulu-Natal district's Mantshensikazi village as a child.In the early 1990s Dlamini fell under the spell of firebrand ANC Natal Midlands leader Harry Gwala and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, both of whom were highly critical of the party's negotiations with the National Party negotiations in which Zuma played a central role. The president has no moral standing from which to chastise his minister for effectively circumventing a Constitutional Court ruling Dlamini's family had moved from Nkandla to Imbali in Pietermaritzburg when she was quite young. It was in this sprawling township, a hotbed of militant youth activism in the 1980s, that her own political activism began.In 1983, she became a founding member of the Imbali Youth Organisation, an affiliate of the United Democratic Front.As a student at the University of Zululand from 1985 to 1989, she was active in the South African National Students Congress.When the ANC was unbanned in 1990, she was one of the people who recently released political prisoners such as Gwala relied upon to help rebuild the organisation's structures in the volatile Midlands region.She was deployed to the ANC Women's League and, from 1992 to 1993, served as its Natal Midland's regional secretary.At the end of 1993, as South Africa was preparing for the official transition from apartheid to democracy, Dlamini was elected deputy secretary-general of the women's league, led by Madikizela-Mandela at the time.'Only Zuma can decide on Dlamini's axing'Both having trained in social work Dlamini has an honours degree in the discipline the two women grew close and over the years Dlamini became known as one of Madikizela-Mandela's staunchest supporters.By the end of 1998, Sis' Batha as Dlamini was affectionately known to her comrades had been elected secretary-general of the women's league, effectively making her the second-most powerful leader in the organisation."The women in the Midlands thought she would be the best person to be secretary ... She was a learned social worker just like Mam'Winnie and we thought they would work very well together," explained a retired activist who worked closely with Dlamini in those days.She held on to that post for 10 years, making her the longest-serving secretary-general of the women's league in the post-apartheid era.Her track record in the position is paradoxical.She was seen as a champion of women's rights, playing a big part in the league's lobbying for gender parity in leadership structures of the ANC and in the government. She also represented South Africa on many international platforms lobbying for gender equality."She was always at the forefront of advocating for women's rights, all the way to the UN," said another activist who worked with her.Yet it was on her watch as secretary-general that the women's league mobilised support for Zuma in 2005 when he was charged with rape.Crowds of women's league members would gather outside the High Court in Johannesburg each morning of the trial not to give moral support to the young woman who claimed to have been violated by Zuma, but to declare their loyalty to him.Zuma was eventually acquitted. But the damage done to the league's reputation as a champion of women's rights was irreparable.It is unclear when Dlamini grew close to Zuma and his political camp, but at some stage in the mid-2000s the two found themselves fighting the same enemy albeit for different reasons.Zuma, then South Africa's deputy president in Thabo Mbeki's administration, was the subject of a Scorpions probe into arms deal corruption that involved his financial adviser and friend Schabir Shaik.Dlamini, meanwhile, found herself on the wrong side of the law as the Scorpions investigated Travelgate a scam in which a number of MPs conspired with travel agencies to defraud parliament.After a protracted investigation by the Scorpions, Dlamini in 2006 pleaded guilty to claiming undue benefits of R254,000 from parliament. She was sentenced to a fine or five years' imprisonment. She paid the fine.It would not have been difficult for Zuma supporters to win her over to their side, as one of their campaigns was to get rid of the Scorpions, which, they claimed, were being used by Mbeki to purge his detractors."Zuma rallied people who were outside of the state as his allies. Dlamini was one of those people and it worked like a charm," said a women's league activist.Even her greatest critics concede that Dlamini is highly skilled in the art of political mobilisation and that having her on your side during an election campaign could be a big plus.She demonstrated this in late 2007, a few days before Zuma and Mbeki fought it out in Polokwane for the ANC presidency.Most political pundits assumed that Mbeki, credited with the ANC's 50-50 gender policy, would get the ANC Women's League nod against Zuma, a politician with a controversial history when it came to women.The league's executive was dominated by women who served in Mbeki's cabinet, with the then home affairs minister, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, as its president. We've strayed far from the SA of our dreamsMoreover, the Mbeki slate had Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma for the deputy presidency, while Zuma's one had a man for the post of deputy. It seemed like a no-brainer.But when the day came for the league to choose its preferred candidate, Dlamini turned the tables on the Mbeki camp delivering an unexpected victory for Zuma.A year later, however, Dlamini suffered a major setback when despite her close ties to Zuma she lost the women's league presidential race to Angie Motshekga, the current minister of basic education.It is then, said a former associate, that Dlamini "began to change" and became more aggressive in dealing with opponents."Ever since she lost to Angie, you can see that something changed. Something snapped."The Bathabile you see today is not the woman we knew ... The political game can get very dirty and maybe her current demeanour is a result of her being compromised in some way or another," said her former colleague as she tried to reconcile the Dlamini she sees on TV today with the activist she worked with in the early '90s.When Zuma came to power in 2009, he did not immediately appoint Dlamini to a ministerial position. He made her deputy minister of social development.A year later, however, she was elevated to the cabinet where she has stayed ever since, thanks largely to her unshakable loyalty to Zuma.Whenever the president has come under fire for one scandal or another, Dlamini has been among the first to publicly defend him.Last year, as some ANC leaders and cabinet ministers demanded that the president step down following the Constitutional Court's damning judgment on Nkandla, Dlamini told the SABC that her comrades had no right to fire the president because all ANC leaders had their "smallanyana skeletons".In parliament she has taken on everyone from opposition MPs to members of the public gallery in defence of the president. Sassa debacle bad news for private sector, tooShe can be rude and threatening, as she was during the 2015 official opening of parliament when she pointed a menacing finger at journalists protesting against signal jamming and said: "You are pushing us too much ... hardening us day by day."This week she body-shamed EFF leader Julius Malema, who has lost a lot of weight over the past year, by shouting in Zulu: "Shut up, you nonsensical slender man!"Throughout the scandal over her insistence on giving Cash Paymaster Services a lucrative new contract to distribute social grants even though its current contract was ruled invalid by the courts, Dlamini has remained defiant knowing that the one person who can fire her is on her side.But there are many other past Zuma loyalists who thought he had their backs when they were in trouble, only to find themselves being thrown under the bus Sicelo Shiceka, Bheki Cele and Dina Pule, to name a few.What makes Dlamini safe?The answer may lie in her ability to mobilise. With the ANC going to its elective conference in December, when Zuma wants Dlamini-Zuma elected as his successor, the women's league of which Dlamini is now president would be a key ally.Although the ANC has not officially opened the leadership race, Dlamini is already on the campaign trail with Dlamini-Zuma.And that may just be enough to save her skin - if her faction does not lose at the conference in December, that is.
