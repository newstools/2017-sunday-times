Universities should reflect multilingual South AfricaThis was the second disturbance at the event after University of the Witwatersrand Vice-Chancellor Professor Adam Habib was heckled off the stage earlier in the day.The convention brought together students as well as stakeholders to find a solution to demands for free higher education following the often violent #FeesMustFall protests across the country.Yesterday's fracas prompted organisers to postpone the event just after lunchtime.The event's co-ordinator, former deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke, lamented a lost opportunity."The dialogue continues. We are going to regroup," Moseneke told students."Look at the donation through the investment we had from so many entities to bring you here, accommodate you. And some among you chose to disrupt this. There is a long, difficult struggle ahead of us."It's not yet uhuru, we can't do it in a disorganised fashion," Moseneke said.Department of Higher Education and Training Director-General Gwebs Qonde said it was a minority of students who prevented Nzimande from addressing the convention."The rest of the students were still demanding that the minister speak. It's unfortunate that that minority couldn't afford everyone a chance to share views."
