Wonga Ntshinga, the senior head of programmes in the faculty of ICT (information and communication technology) at the Independent Institute of Education, says: "You are at a tremendous disadvantage if your CV is poorly written and does not sell you effectively, and it is almost certain that you won't be invited to an interview if that is the case."It is also not a good idea to submit the same CV, no matter how well written, for every application. Rather, says Ntshinga, tailor it to the position you are applying for."While this does take time and effort, a generic CV will not take you anywhere." 4 ways to avoid burnout He has the following advice: Each industry has a "typical" CV, so make sure that if you are applying for a job in advertising, your r sum looks the part. "Google is your friend. Do an image search for CV examples in your industry, and demonstrate that you are in touch with the culture and approach to business in your chosen sector;" Give examples of things you have done to demonstrate that you are the kind of person the company is looking for, rather than simply listing your skills; You have less than 10 seconds to impress the HR manager. Read your CV and make sure that all your main selling points can be picked up quickly. A CV is not the place for long explanations or purple prose; short and to the point is what you are going for; and Be brief, but not at the expense of the details that show the HR manager that you are the right person for the job. Use facts and figures to illustrate what you have done and why that makes you the right candidate.
