Despite his impressive form this season, scoring 17 Premier League goals, Costa's Chelsea future remains in doubt with sources claiming the club are ready to listen to offers for him.It remains to be seen whether or not that proves to be the case, but Chelsea's position has not been changed by an interview Costa has done this week with Spanish radio. Drogba the legend has been an inspiration for me, says CostaDespite insisting he is happy to stay at Chelsea, the 28-year-old Costa has refused to rule out a move to China and has spoken openly about how he tried to force a return to Atl tico last season.He was involved in a training ground row with manager Antonio Conte in January, following an enormous offer from Chinese Super League club Tianjin Quanjian.It is understood that Chelsea feared there was a real chance Costa would leave in January before he and Conte called a truce for the remainder of the season.Talks over a new contract have been shelved and Conte is keen to sign at least one new striker possibly two with Alvaro Morata and Romelu Lukaku high on Chelsea's list of targets.Where that leaves Costa remains unclear, but the Brazil-born Spanish international has confirmed he will move to China if Chelsea accept a bid for him even though he will not fight to force a transfer.Asked if the Chinese Super League could still be an option in the summer, Costa told El Larguero: "Anything can happen. Why not?"You never know. Now I'm happy at Chelsea but if tomorrow the Chinese come and Chelsea tell me I have to go, I will no longer want to stay with them."Atl tico could also renew their bid to re-sign Costa if their transfer embargo is lifted.Costa would no doubt be interested in a return to Spain, having attempted to engineer a move 12 months ago."I did all that I could to return but it didn't happen," said Costa."When Atl tico had to wait for me, they didn't wait. There was still a month to go [until the end of transfer window] and they didn't have the patience."On Conte's first day, I told him that I wanted to join Atl tico and he was upset with me and didn't even look at me."Luckily, I started to score goals."
