That leaves the door open for Willie le Roux (41 caps) and seasoned loose forwards Francois Louw (52) and Duane Vermeulen (37).Of the 50 Springboks capped since Heyneke Meyer's tenure in 2012, only Le Roux and Eben Etzebeth have crossed the 30-cap mark.Former Bok coach Dick Muir said he didn't agree with the 30-cap ruling but understood the need to keep the players in the country. More Super Rugby depression as Sanzaar meets"I don't believe they should be selecting any of the overseas players and the new policy that is being implemented is keeping the door open for those who want to leave anyway," Muir said. "There's a lot of test rugby and they can accumulate those caps very easily. Something needed to be done but I'm not sure this was the right step."While the June international break is still three months away with plenty of Super Rugby in-between to further sift the grain from the chaff, there are five players, three being front-row forwards, who could draw the short end of the stick:Steven Kitshoff (25)(Bordeaux, 10 caps) The ginger-haired loosehead is a Coetzee pet project from the Stormers but is 20 short of the target.His talent and longevity in the game is not in doubt, even though a loosehead is not a position South African rugby tends to battle with.Kitshoff has impressed when given an opportunity but he could find himself outflanked by his South African-based contemporaries.Marcell Coetzee (26)(Ulster, 28 caps) Unless the former Sharks openside flanker cracks the nod for the French series, he risks being unable to play for the Boks after June.Two serious knee injuries in the past two years curtailed his international participation and robbed him of a chance to add to his Bok caps. The jury is still out on his effectiveness after Louw and Vermeulen were below par after taxing European seasons.However, he could be a different and well-rested player after missing the better part of last year with a knee injury.Vincent Koch (26)(Saracens, nine caps) While Frans Malherbe could be in the pound seat because of Julian Redelinghuys's neck injury, Koch was a formidable competitor at the Stormers and provides an excellent overseas-based option.His game will improve against the better European scrummagers but that skill could be lost to the Springboks after July 1.It will be a case of him counting the cost of putting the pound ahead of his international aspirations.Cobus Reinach (27)(Currently with the Sharks but will move to Northampton Saints, nine caps) SA Rugby's dragging of their feet in regards to Reinach's move to England will linger for some time, but in an age in which South Africa's scrumhalf cupboard is not overflowing with talent, Reinach could be a big loss.He could have bided his time with neither the Bull's Rudy Page nor Faf de Klerk of the Lions convincing at test level last year.Marcel van der Merwe (26)(Toulon, seven caps) While Van Der Merwe has always been on the Bok periphery due to injury, when on form, he has always been a decent performer. But like Kitshoff, he could find himself being forgotten due to competitors staying in South Africa and fighting for the badge.Van Der Merwe last featured for the Boks in 2015.
