Mikhael Subotzky is dressed in his customary working overalls, carefully supervising the installation of his three-channel film 'WYE' when we meet at the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg on a rainy morning.The project, a departure for the artist known for his documentary photography, is his first foray into fiction film.It consists of three 15-minute films, shown on three screens, that were shot in the Cape Recife Nature Reserve near Port Elizabeth. They were first shown at the Sherman Contemporary Art Foundation in Sydney last year. Artist Thania Petersen's photographic self-portraits revise colonial historyThis week marks the film's South African debut and Subotzky is interested to see how local audiences will react to his examination of the white colonial male psyche. The film shows three linked stories set in the past, present and future and connected, as the title suggests, by the Y-shaped geographical configuration of Britain, Australia and South Africa.The two colonies and their coloniser try and fail to come to terms with the impossibility of projecting their desires on an unforgiving landscape, one which JM Coetzee described in White Writing as "alien, impenetrable, until a language is found in which to win it, speak it, represent it".The audience sits in deck chairs arranged on sand, which creates a space within the gallery that reflects the location of the films, as the interplay between the three stories leads towards a series of revelations about the interconnections between the different eras.In the first film, Feio, a disembodied, gender-neutral Australian psycho-anthropologist inhabits the body memories of a South African expat named Craig Hare (played by Anthony Coleman) at the moment that he types an e-mail to a relative in Australia in which he decides to "pack for Perth".The second film shows Hare a few hours earlier - he's a lighthouse keeper who spends his days with a metal detector, combing the beach for treasures. He has an awkward encounter with a coloured homeless man named Hermanus who helps him unearth an old box containing a letter written by an 1820 settler, James T Lethbridge.The third film tells the story of Lethbridge (played by John Nankin) as he goes mad following his unsuccessful attempts to come to terms with an "aberrant land" which, as he writes in his letter, causes "a disarrangement of your senses". WATCH Mikhael Subotzky speaking about his film WYE The crystallisation of the complex relationship between these threads is the result of a process begun in 2007 when Gene Sherman (a South African who emigrated to Australia in 1976) first approached Subotzky to commission a work for her gallery.In 2013 Subotzky travelled to Sydney to see the space and it was then that he read art critic Robert Hughes's book about the founding of Australia, The Fatal Shore.Subotzky said it struck him with its description of "the geographic unconscious and how the British projection onto the landscape of Australia changed very quickly from the Eden of Darwin and The Beagle and Captain Cook, to this other upside-down landscape".This inhospitable landscape, Subotzky says, "justified just using Australia as a dumping ground"."Seeing that projection onto the landscape contrasted so much with the typical 'packing for Perth' South African projection, which is like, 'Australia's landscape is ideal, it's just the same as South Africa, it's just the same lifestyle except without all the problems'."So for me that inversion of projections onto the Australian landscape was a trigger that really interested me."Local photographers are finally getting more exposure for their artRather than approach the subject through abstraction, Subotzky decided to examine the colonial mind-set from the inside. He sees this as a logical progression in his work which "first was very documentary - photographing the effects of apartheid and colonialism and prisons and poverty"."[This] felt like it was important for me to do 10 years ago when I was discovering the world around me as a conscious adult, but I guess more and more I've become ambivalent about photography, ambivalent about making representations, ambivalent about describing the effects of apartheid from without."So it made sense to me to channel and get inside that mind-set and collapse it from within rather than describe its effect from without."The potential self-indulgent pitfalls that might accompany a white South African's examination of white identity in a time when white privilege and indifference have become hot issues in public debate are offset by the failure of the characters to overcome the challenges that their arrogance prevents them from facing.Produced by Laurence Hamburger and filmed by legendary cinematographer and long-time Werner Herzog collaborator J rg Schmidt-Reitwein, the final product is a multi-layered and relevant examination of the fallacies of an unfounded attitude of superiority.Hopefully audiences who accept WYE's challenges will see that Subotzky is also challenging himself."At the end of the day I am working, and I want to make work about the things that interest me," he says. "I think that just as it's important to be quiet about some things, it's also very important that white people do engage with the burden and the guilt and the legacy of our privilege." 'WYE' is at the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg until April 1.
