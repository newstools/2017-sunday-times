A study by Harvard University suggests that ingesting only small amounts of gluten, or avoiding it altogether, increases the danger of diabetes by as much as 13%. Rising numbers of consumers are banishing gluten from their diet. Gluten is found in wheat, rye and barley and gives food elasticity during the baking process.Only around 1% of people are genuinely gluten-intolerant, a condition called coeliac disease. However, some estimates put the proportion of adults following gluten-free diets in the UK at more than 12%. The researchers behind the new study suggest that people who do not have coeliac disease should reconsider limiting their gluten intake.The Harvard team examined 30 years of medical data from nearly 200,000 patients. They found that most participants had a gluten intake of below 12g a day, roughly the equivalent to two or three slices of wholemeal bread.Within this range, those eating the most gluten had a 13% lower risk of developing Type2 diabetes compared with those eating just 4g a day.
