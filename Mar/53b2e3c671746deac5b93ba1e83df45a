Against a backdrop of the snow-capped Himalayas, Smith smashed 14 fours in a 111-run innings to become the first Australian captain to hit three centuries in a single test series in India.The 27-year-old also became only the second visiting captain to hit three hundreds in a series after England's Alastair Cook.Australia, however, squandered a promising start to be bowled out for 300 just minutes before the close of play after winning the toss.They looked in control, having cruised to 131/1 at lunch but Kuldeep's spell sent them tumbling and they lost nine wickets in the last two sessions. The chinaman bowler ended with four wickets.The 22-year-old unorthodox left-arm spinner was brought in as a last-minute replacement for skipper Virat Kohli, who has not recovered from a shoulder injury.The test debutant picked up his first wicket when he had David Warner (56) caught by stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane in the slips.Kuldeep struck soon afterwards to send back Peter Handscomb with a ball that turned in and hit the stumps.Glenn Maxwell also lost his wicket to the wrist-spinner, misreading a googly.Smith had put on 134 runs for the second wicket with Warner after Australia lost opener Matt Renshaw in the second over.The captain underlined his reputation as the world No1 test batsman, reaching his 20th century and his seventh in his last eight tests against India.Smith's runs meant he remained on top of the batting chart in the series with 482 runs from seven innings.He was out to offspinner Ravichandran Ashwin, with Rahane taking another catch in the slips.Smith's run in the series has been in contrast to Kohli, who managed only 46 runs from three tests. Before this game, Kohli had played 54 tests without missing a match since November 2011.With the series tied 1-1 going into the finale, India must win the match to regain the Border-Gavaskar trophy.
