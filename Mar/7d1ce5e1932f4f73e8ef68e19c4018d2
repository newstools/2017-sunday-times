As well as the boot, the thimble and the wheelbarrow are set to be jettisoned from the board and will be replaced with a T-Rex, a rubber Ducky and a Penguin. In the lead up to World Monopoly Day, March 19, Hasbro, which owns the rights to the iconic board game decided to poll fans in 100 countries as to what should and shouldn't be in the next iteration of the game. And via a combination of 64 potential objects and 4.3 million votes cast, the company has arrived at a new set of eight player tokens that will be included in the next generation of the game, which lands in stores this August.And in terms of voter popularity, those tokens will be the Scottie Dog; a T-Rex; the Top Hat; the Car; a Rubber Ducky; a Cat; a Penguin; and a Battleship."The global Monopoly community has spoken!" said Jonathan Berkowitz, senior vice president of marketing for Hasbro Gaming. "The next generation of tokens clearly represents the interests of our fans around the world."
