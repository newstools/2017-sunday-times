Just when you thought that high fashion labels only aimed their advertising at an over-30 generation that can afford the high prices on the ticket, Gucci's Alessandro Michele is using internet culture and language to launch the new Le March des Merveilles watch collection - with memes.Gucci paired artists around the world like @pollynor and @johnyuyi with meme creators like @beigecardigan to make branded memes. The campaign is dubbed #TFWGucci.Some of the memes feature original photographs. There are also old paintings that Gucci has altered. Each meme features a watch from the March des Merveilles front and centre.The Gucci Memes You Never Knew You Needed ft.@beigecardigan and @textsfromyourexistentialist #genius https://t.co/nGt3X3IvxE pic.twitter.com/IKa3EiGbT4The brand said in a press statement: "For #TFWGucci, international meme creators have been approached to either create a meme themselves, incorporating Gucci imagery, or to propose an idea that the house can realise by inviting a visual artist."But Maria Bobila, writing for the blog Fashionista, was one fashion commentator who was not impressed."Of all the brands in the world, did Gucci really have to tap into internet youth culture to sell $870 watches?" she asks."The trickle-down effect is bound to happen in the fashion and beauty marketing world.
