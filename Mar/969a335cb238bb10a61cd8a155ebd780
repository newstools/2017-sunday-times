Timothy - known as Timmy - was an 11-year-old African grey parrot whose death two weeks ago has left his owner, Marla Govender, bereft.A grieving Govender, 46, said she would have a tomb unveiling at her Phoenix home."Timmy was my child. It was like losing a family member who I loved."Govender said she got Timmy when he was three days old as a birthday gift. "Parrots are supposed to outlive you. I never expected him to go so soon."She said that on the morning of his death, the bird was his usual self."It was only later in the day that we noticed he was unusually quiet. Generally when someone passed him he would say something."I thought it was the heat and took his cage inside and I tried to cool him down with water. I noticed his breathing was laboured," Govender said. "I took him to a vet but by the time we got to the vet he had passed on."She said his last words were "take me outside".She said the parrot's burial was witnessed by about 40 close family members.Last Saturday Govender held a memorial service at her Phoenix home, which was attended by about 70 people."In keeping with Hindu tradition we abstained from meat and fasted for the seven days until Saturday's prayer, when we laid out Timmy's favourite food. We were supposed to prepare vegetables, but knew Timmy hated that," Govender said."He had a penchant for hot wings, and my sister would tell him he's eating his cousins. He loved chocolate cake with bubblegum ganache, the sweetmeat jelebi, queen cakes and roasted peanuts."Govender said that for the 40 days of mourning she would leave out water and food for Timmy.</img> Timmy's grave under a litchi tree next to its owner's house.
