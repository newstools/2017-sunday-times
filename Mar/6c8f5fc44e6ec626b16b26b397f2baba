Art meets fashion in Edda Gimnes larger-than-life, hand-painted silhouettes. The Norwegian designer presented her SS17 collection of wearable sketches as part of the Lufthansa 1st Class Collections show alongside a handful of African designers. Local designer Sheila Madge won the Lufthansa Award for her nature-meets-avant-garde-inspired collection. As the winner, Madge will have the opportunity to present her designs at Berlin Fashion Week. Graphic eyebrows were a highlight of note at the Lufthansa 1st Class Collections and Edda Gimnes shows. As if sketched on with a black khoki pen, the imperfect brows were matched with loosely crimped, retro-inspired hair.The baby doll look was given an ethereal twist at the DUT X: Rise Of The OXX Collection shows. Hair was twisted into high pigtails, knotted at the crown and embellished with gold and silver threads. The makeup was kept simple with spider-like lashes and bright, popsicle-stained lips. Ricci Lee Kalish, the blogger behind Big Bad Wolf, looked striking in a blush pink Zara suit.
