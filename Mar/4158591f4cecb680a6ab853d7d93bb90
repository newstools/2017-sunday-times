A major sporting body, rejecting the revenue-sharing model that perpetuates vast earning inequalities between men and women, has instituted a system where life as a professional female athlete becomes a legitimate means to draw not just a living wage, but an attractive one.As of July 9, the average salary of international women cricketers in the country will rise to 109,000 a year. That is more than double the figure on offer to their English counterparts.When Charlotte Edwards, erstwhile captain of the national side, learnt in 2014 via her car radio that she and her teammates would be offered central deals worth 40,000 a year, she was so shocked that she almost swerved off the road.It signified a level of progress she had never expected to see in her lifetime. But even this unexpected moment of enlightenment at the England and Wales Cricket Board has been left in the dust by Cricket Australia's latest action."Cricket has led the charge in providing a real sporting career path for women," James Sutherland, chief executive of Cricket Australia, argued. "This offer locks in all of that hard work. It is truly a historic development that allows us to say with confidence that cricket is a sport for all Australians."For once, one can agree that the rhetoric is matched by the reality.This is a land that has already turned elite female cricketers into fully fledged TV stars. Alyssa Healy, the Australian wicketkeeper, is a poster girl here not so much because of her marriage to fast bowler Mitchell Starc, but in recognition of her explosive power-hitting. In one Twenty20 international, she lashed 90 off 61 balls.Now, women are poised at last to reap a greater share of the riches. They still trail their male colleagues by a colossal margin test perennials such as Steve Smith and David Warner stand to amass 1.5-million apiece this year, plus endorsements but there is no impression that they are a downtrodden afterthought.Sutherland was at pains to stress that it was time for sport to "walk the talk" on matters of equal pay.He has proved as good as his word. By providing six-figure remuneration for Australia's representatives, he has turned women's cricket into an object of aspiration for young athletes.
