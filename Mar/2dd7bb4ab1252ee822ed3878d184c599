Known better as Stormzy, his latest album, Gang Signs and a Prayer, is doing all kinds of celebratory acrobatics at the top of UK music charts and going toe to toe with the likes of Ed Sheeran in the process.Currently serving as Grime's highest ranking attach , Stormzy's latest album is an interesting experiment in how to balance a multifaceted personality on one album.Hip-hop & house had a love child: it's called Grime music (& it's trending)On tracks like Bad Boys, Cold and Big for Your Boots, he is Mr Skeng, a real "bad man" well acquainted with violence and viscerally repulsed by fakeness.In this incarnation Stormzy is brilliant. He is coolly intimidating, walking the line between glorifying violence and simply describing his surroundings. His lyrical flows and wordplay leave you feeling the urge to don a black hoodie, dim the lights and stomp around pretending you do "bad man tings".His alter ego is much softer. Whether on Cigarettes and Cush or both parts of Blinded by Your Grace we are introduced to Michael Omari, a sweet Christian boy, who loves his mom and just happened to grow up in the wrong environment.In this manifestation Stormzy is a young man who struggles with love, friendship and being an underdog. He even tries his hand at singing with surprisingly impressive results and is good to listen to.The problem, however, is that the two don't gel very well. Bad Boys, a dark song about people pretending to be real gangsters, is immediately followed by the first Blinded by Your Grace, which could easily be played in the youth chapter of a church.The effect is not only jarring but often smacks of Chance the Rapper which can be hard to digest if you are not religious.Gang Signs and a Prayer is a good album and when he is in Mr Skeng mode it's half a notch below brilliant. What ultimately counts against it is the album's arrangement, which does little to introduce us to Michael Omari, instead opting to throw him through our window peddling Jehovah's Witness pamphlets.WATCH the music video for Stormzy's track Big For Your Boots 'Gang Signs and a Prayer' is available on iTunes
