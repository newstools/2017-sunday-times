Around 1.1million people are expected to pass through the world's busiest international airport as the United Arab Emirates' spring break school holidays start, Dubai Airports said. An estimated 260,000 travellers were expected to pass through each day from Friday through Monday. The US has imposed a ban on all electronics larger than a standard smartphone on board direct flights out of eight countries across the Middle East. US officials would not specify how long the ban will last, but Emirates said it had been instructed to enforce it until at least October 14. The ban also covers items sold at Dubai Duty Free, Dubai Airports CEO Paul Griffiths told local radio. State-owned Emirates operates 18 flights daily to the US out of Dubai. The ban has sparked anger across the region for targeting Muslim countries. Britain has imposed a similar prohibition affecting flights out of Egypt, Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Lebanon.
