This week the House of Busby, which owns the rights to Mango and Nine West stores in South Africa, said it would close the flagship store, as well as stand-alone Mango and Nine West outlets country wide. All were opened at great expense.Leane Adolph, head of marketing at the House of Busby, said Mango and Nine West merchandise would be available only in Edgars stores.Adolph said the company regularly reviewed the portfolio's performance and relevance to market and decided to move the Mango business into the store-in-store concept in Edgars . Biggest digital portal for top Italian brands hits SAHouse of Busby has an agreement with Edcon, the owner of Edgars, for its licence arrangement with Topshop and Topman brands, and Guess, Aldo, Forever New, Nine West and Steve Madden. The company also supplies wholesale merchandise to Edgars.An Edcon spokesman said: "Edcon has had a long and positive relationship with House of Busby and we have been advised that this will continue."But Edcon, which recently reached an "amicable" resolution with international brand River Island to wind down its franchising relationship as part of its strategy to consolidate the international brands it sells, said it evaluated each brand separately and "specifically on its value proposition for our customers in line with our brand strategy and return on investment".The move this week by House of Busby may signal a challenging retail environment.An analyst said: "It's quite expensive to [secure exclusive rights] ... where people are trading down, looking for cheaper options."The higher-priced retailers could also be under some pressure. Also, taxes have come through and that super-tax impacts their customer base."We've seen it with Stuttafords and now Busby doing the same. It's normal store rationalisation ... I do think there will be more to follow ... but it does not bode well for shopping malls because all of a sudden you have more stores that are vacant," the analyst said.In the past year, Busby has acquired the master licences for two new brands, Women's Secret and 3INA, to diversify its brand portfolio from footwear, apparel and luggage to include intimate apparel and cosmetics.Adolph said: "We are confident that this decision will focus the business on the growth of the newly acquired brands and optimisation of the existing portfolio, re-emphasising the importance of great customer service and a commitment to delivering consistent, quality, international product at prices that reflect customer value."Mango is present in 13 African countries with 70 stores.This makes it the international fashion brand with the biggest presence in Africa.tshandup@sundaytimes.co.za
