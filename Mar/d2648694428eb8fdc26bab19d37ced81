Vinyl Sundays brings together the best dealers for a family friendly bacchanal of vinyl, food and drink on the first Sunday of every month."What sets us apart from other vinyl fairs is quality. All our dealers are hand-picked and leading specialists," said Bret Dougmore, a vinyl dealer and event co-organiser.Fairs like this are a boon for those dipping a cautious toe into the world of vinyl records."Fairs like ours are great for beginners because it allows people to stretch their budgets."Where R500 might only get you one or two vinyls elsewhere, you could easily walk away from Vinyl Sundays with about 10 vinyls for that money," said Dugmore.The resurrection of South African bubblegum popStock is sourced from nooks and crannies across the land, be it in boxes in old buildings in the Johannesburg CBD, or from someone's neglected garage on the East Rand.This breadth of their sources means that the dealers at Vinyl Sundays offer everything from rare struggle-era South African jazz to the latest Ed Sheeran."It really depends on the demographic of the people at the fair, but older South African jazz is hugely sought after."At the same time Solange's new album was really popular last year," said Dugmore.Beware though. While most new albums do get released in vinyl format, they tend to cost a fair amount more than second-hand records. Among other popular genres are 1980s pop a la Madonna, hard rock and Daft Punk-style electronica.As a way to spend a Sunday afternoon, hunting for quality vinyl records, it is a pretty good one. Pair that with craft beer, artisanal food and a place for rug rats to run around in and it isn't hard to see why this event has been running longer than most of its contemporaries. Vinyl Sundays takes place at Stanley Beer Yard, 44 Stanley Avenue, Auckland Park, from 10am to 3pm. Visit facebook.com/vinylfair. This article was originally published in The Times.
