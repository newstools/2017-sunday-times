Chiefs had been bundled out in the first round of the competition last season by Orlando Pirates and have not won the top knockout prize since 2013 but made an emphatic statement with their away victory.After the match, a satisfied Chiefs coach Steve Komphela said: "These games are not easy and they pressed us well. We had to rethink our strategy and finally we did it."It was Stellenbosch who threw in the first shot, a stinging left-footer, after eight minutes from Diego Brown that tested whether Nhlanhla Khuzwayo was alert in the Chiefs goal. Khuzwayo was one of six changes that Komphela made after last weekend's derby draw with Pirates. Cape Bees' clash is the perfect platform for Bucs to bounce back to winning waysAttacking midfielder Lucky Baloyi drifted in late to have Chiefs' first decent effort on the quarter-hour mark as P ez put in a chip pass. Baloyi had a similar effort about 20 minutes later that also flew over the top in a first half of restricted opportunity.The best chance fell to Stellenbosch near the break, when they caught Chiefs on the counterattack after Willard Katsande had been stripped of the ball. But referee Thando Ndzandzeka made a bad error in not allowing advantage, stopping play instead to caution the Chiefs captain.Stellenbosch were away on goal when the referee blew the whistle to deny the hosts a clear chance at goal.Straight after the break, Amakhosi went ahead after some good work from P ez who provided a cross from outside on the right and lofted the ball over the home defence for the diminutive Joseph Molangoane to head into an empty net.Stellenbosch looked stung after giving away such an easy goal and sat back to allow Chiefs to take midfield control after pressing their visitors so effectively in the first half.In the 58th minute, a floated Chiefs cross was poorly cleared by Stellenbosch centre-back Junaid Sait and set up perfectly for Siphiwe Tshabalala to blast home with a perfect left-footed shot from outside the area to double the lead.A tactical switch allowed the hosts to get back into the match in the final 20 minutes and twice Khuzwayo was forced to make important saves.Venezuelan international P ez finally got a goal with eight minutes to go, beating the offside trap and getting behind the defensive line on the end of a great pass from George Lebese. The 26-year-old rounded off Stellenbosch goalkeeper Washington Arubi and tucked the ball away.
