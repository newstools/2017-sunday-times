What does your job entail?My role as Hart's IVF co-ordinator and theatre manager is to ensure, from the point of first contact, that our patients are guided through their fertility journey - an emotional roller coaster - one step at a time, with all the information they need to feel empowered and involved in their treatment, whether it's artificial insemination, IVF or a donor-egg IVF cycle.I am the patients' liaison to the doctor, their encourager and therapist, as well as their main go-to person for whatever they need as they go through the labyrinth of their fertility treatment.I teach my patients how to mix their drugs and how to administer them. I order their medications and inform them of their doctor's visits.I let them know what to expect of their appointments with us, whether it's just for a scan and blood, or if it's their day of egg retrieval or embryo transfer.I also answer their questions on the phone, respond to their e-mails, and offer them advice and suggestions as needed.Describe an average day at work.My day begins at 9am, usually at full steam ahead. If we have theatre cases, such as egg retrievals or embryo transfers, I ensure the theatre is set and ready to go. I then admit my patients. We go through the relevant consent forms together, and I explain the day's procedure to them, answering any questions they might have.I accompany my patient into the theatre and assist the anaesthetist with the anaesthetic (if applicable).Once my patient is safely asleep, I assist the doctor with the egg retrieval. My main function in theatre is to ensure that everything runs smoothly, on time and according to plan.I will then recover my patient post anaesthetic until they are ready to be discharged.If we do an embryo transfer, I am responsible for the ultrasound scanning of the abdomen, to help ensure correct placement of the embryos.A large proportion of my day is attending to e-mails and phone calls, assisting patients with the planning and scheduling of their treatment, and ensuring that they know exactly what to do and when.What is the best part of your job?Without a doubt assisting our patients to achieve their dream of becoming parents.It's the most rewarding and heart-warming feeling getting that first positive pregnancy test.And the worst part?On the flip side, the worst part of my job is that fertility treatment is not always successful and unfortunately, sometimes, not all of our patients get to experience the positive outcome they so desperately want. It's heartbreaking!Why did you choose to be a nurse?I chose to do nursing as I find it incredibly rewarding and fulfilling to assist those in need.I was drawn into fertility nursing by my passion for women's health.Is your work stressful?Yes, fertility nursing can be quite stressful at times, due to the nature of what's at stake.How did you become an IVF co-ordinator?To become an IVF co-ordinator, you need to be a registered nurse with the South African Nursing Council. This entails a four-year qualification (either a degree or diploma). After your community service, you may wish to gain some experience working in reproductive health clinics and then approach the various fertility clinics for more advice on available positions.
