Ibrahimovic, United's top scorer with 26 goals, was fortunate not to be sent off before seeing a penalty saved as Jos Mourinho's side missed the opportunity to move into the Champions League places.Marcos Rojo gave Red Devils the lead with his first league goal for the club, before former United forward Joshua King equalised from the penalty spot five minutes before the first half ended. But the game centred on a series of incidents in succession at the end of the half, in which both Ibrahimovic and Tyrone Mings were lucky to escape red cards. 'I want to reinvent myself at Arsenal'Bournemouth defender Mings appeared to stamp on the head of the former Paris Saint-Germain forward. Ibrahimovic, already on a yellow card, then elbowed the centre-back in the face seconds later, but received only a telling off from referee Kevin Friend.Both Ibrahimovic and Mings are likely to face retrospective disciplinary action from the Football Association.In the ensuing melee, Cherries midfielder Andrew Surman shoved Ibrahimovic and was shown a second yellow card.But Surman was shown a red card after United left-back Luke Shaw reminded Friend he had already been booked.Artur Boruc, the visitors' 37-year-old goalkeeper, had a fine match, making a series of saves against a dominant United side.His best moment was keeping out Ibrahimovic's penalty with just under 20 minutes to go, getting down low to his right to push the ball aside.The single point means United remain in sixth place, where they have remained since early November, while Bournemouth ended a run of four successive league defeats.The Cherries looked as if they would be overwhelmed in the first half-hour of a match that reached boiling point as the interval approached.United created a host of chances, with the recalled Wayne Rooney, Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial going close.Their resistance was broken midway through the half as Rojo deflected in Antonio Valencia's cross-shot to score his first league goal for United.But Bournemouth, who had spurned one early chance as Benik Afobe slipped when clear, drew level five minutes before half time.King struck a penalty into David de Gea's top right-hand corner after Phil Jones had brought down Marc Pugh.Boruc then made further fine reaction saves to deny Rooney and Ibrahimovic, before the match's two key flashpoints occurred in the final moments of the half.
