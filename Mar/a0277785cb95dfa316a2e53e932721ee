Our formative years were in a small West Coast town where baking played a large role in social interaction and everybody baked for bazaars and f tes. When visiting you were invariably offered something sweet and homemade.Mari-Louis has been talking people out of their family recipes since her early teens, so we have quite a collection. 3 Milk tarts from The South African Milk Tart collection We baked hundreds of milk tarts for the book - and yes, we can certainly eat another milk tart.The classic milk tart has an interesting and varied history. By the time the colony was started at the Cape, there already were instances of a custard baked in pastry. However, it was with cinnamon that made its way from Java and naartjies from Indonesia (the Tamil word for citrus is nartei) that we see the emergence of our true South African milk tart. Our version has a higher milk-to-egg ratio than European versions such as the French flan, English custard tart and the Portuguese pastei de nata.We used lots and lots of milk and eggs, way too much to even keep track, when putting the milk tart book together. We might just be responsible for the water shortage in Cape Town as we understand it takes a whole lot of water to produce a litre of milk.The flavourants for the custard can range from vanilla to naartjie peel, peach leaves, nutmeg, cardamom, caramel, rum and brandy and we have not even started on the pastry.When baking all the milk tarts for the book the first few batches promptly disappeared between us, the photographer, kitchen staff and family, but as word got around that we were working on the book we had lots of friends popping into the studio at the end of the day for milk tart and wine.The photography part of the book took us about 12 days, but research, gathering recipes, testing and deciding what to include in the book, writing and editing was spread out over about nine months. It was like giving birth. The South African Milk Tart Collection' by Callie Maritz and Mari-Louis Guy is published by NB Publishers.
