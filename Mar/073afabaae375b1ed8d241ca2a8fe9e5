We put out a call to our readers to be part of the panel of tasters.They came together on a Saturday morning and were presented with three ham and pineapple pizzas from leading supermarkets - with no branding - on separate plates.Each pizza was baked according to package instructions (most at 200 C for 7-9 minutes).Auditor Jade Craig was on hand to monitor the objectivity of the blind-tasting process, from removing the packaging to numbering the products, overseeing the preparation and adding up the score sheets. Judges' comments: Tasters liked the plump pieces of pineapple and generous slices of ham. The cheese browned nicely and the base was crispy, although some said it was too toast-like and could have had a narrower border. Overall, it was rated very decent for a store-bought pizza, if a little on the bland side.Price: R61.50Where to buy South Africa's creamiest, cheesiest macaroni cheese Judges' comments: The base was described as "well-baked, tasty and crispy", but the cheese, pineapple and ham toppings were very poorly distributed - some slices had no topping whatsoever. Those who received a well-topped slice said the ham and cheese were the best quality of all the samples.Price: R69.99 Judges' comments: Described by some as "soggy", this pizza remained pale after being baked according to package instructions. "It's too mushy, and all the ingredients got lost in each other," said a panellist.Another said it tasted more like macaroni and cheese than pizza.
