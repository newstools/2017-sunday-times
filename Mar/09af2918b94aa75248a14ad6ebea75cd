Here s our pick of highlights from SAFW Day 1:Young designer Thebe Magugu debuted his highly-anticipated collection to much acclaim. He sent a combination of flirty and edgy silhouettes down the runway and showed a deft hand when it came to choosing a colour palette for his collection - think burgundy paired with pops of citrus orange and deep denims teamed crisp pinstripe blues. This is one designer to watch in 2017. Style By SA is an exclusive capsule collection created by a handful of the country's best designers for Woolworths. The collection, which included clothes, accessories and shoes by Rich Mnisi, Thebe Magugu, AKJP, Selfi, Young + Lazy, Sol Sol, Maria McCloy and Pichulik, was a remarkable display of SA talent.By working with the retailer, these local designers were able to get on board with the global trend of presenting 'see now, buy now' collections. This means you don't have to wait the usual four to six months for these looks to hit stores, you can shop select pieces online now. The entire collection will be available in store from April 12. As the chill of autumn sets in, the resort collections presented had us dreaming about the balmy, bikini-clad days of summer 2018. We spotted several pieces in by The Hive, Lalesso and Akina's new lines that'll be on our must-have list next season. Beauty-wise, Day 1 was all about flushed, iridescent skin and glossy lips. Models looked as if they had walked straight off of an island; glowing with sun-kissed tones of copper, coral and peach. At Styled By SA and Akina the focus was on the cheeks with a creamy pink blush worked into the cheek bone. While at Lalesso and Gabrielle Swimwear, skin was more golden with bronzed cheeks and glossy coral lips.Hair was effortless with soft loose waves at Keyes Fashion, while Summerheart showed post-ocean swim hair: a seasalt spray textured ponytail with a deep side-parting.
