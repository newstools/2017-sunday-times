Chilean director Pablo Larrain and writer Noah Oppenheim focus their biopic on the days following the assassination.They cut back and forth between an interview Kennedy gives to an unnamed journalist (Billy Crudup) about her determination to ensure that her husband received a worthy funeral, and her much publicised television appearance during the first months of Kennedy's presidency in which she gave a tour of the White House to the US public.Anchored by a cracking performance from Natalie Portman in the title role, the film offers an intimate portrait of a woman under siege from all sides who ultimately stuck to her guns and created one of the 20th century's most memorable media events, ensuring the legacy of the Kennedys' Camelot for generations to come.'Fences' movie review: Denzel Washington & Viola Davis' towering performances live up to the Oscar hypeIntimate and often claustrophobic, the film is beautifully shot by St phane Fontaine. It creates a complex and engaging portrait of the struggle of its heroine to maintain her well publicised charm and poise in the face of a staggering emotional tragedy.She's also forced to realise that the fairy-tale Camelot of which she was once the queen has disappeared into memory faster than she could ever have imagined.It's a credit to Portman that she manages to convey the many different layers of Kennedy as icon, widow under pressure to keep her family together, and Catholic questioning her faith in the light of seemingly senseless loss.It's not an easy film to watch and it doesn't offer a potted history of its subject, requiring some dedication and knowledge on the part of the audience to make its point, but it is all the more rewarding because of this.With a compelling end-of-days performance by the late John Hurt as Kennedy's priest, and suitably restrained turns from Crudup and Peter Sarsgaard as Bobby Kennedy, Larrain creates a thoughtful portrait of the disintegration of a dream and the uncertainty beyond its end.It's also a compelling examination of myths and their making that reflects on broader questions of the power of stories and how what is left out can be as powerful and sometimes more important than what is included.In the end Jackie is a curiously difficult but rewarding film about a strangely elusive and reserved woman who continues to intrigue because she knew how to curate her public image and kept her private life very private.WATCH the trailer for Jackie What other reviewers say Intensely affecting and insistently protean, the film 'Jackie' is a reminder that for a time Jacqueline Kennedy was bigger than any star, bigger than Marilyn or Liz. - Manohla Dargis, New York Times Chilean director Larrain's status as the most daring and prodigious political filmmaker of his generation remains undimmed. - Guy Lodge, Variety What emerges is an unsettling, almost hallucinogenic study in contradiction: Portman's Jackie is soft yet steely, vulnerable yet shrewd. - Ann Hornaday, Washington Post This article was originally published in The Times.
