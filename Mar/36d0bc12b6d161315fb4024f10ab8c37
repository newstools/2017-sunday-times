Although it is not possible to determine which South African companies import meat from Brazil, major retailers were quick to respond to the department's decision.Shoprite, which sources 98% of its chicken from South African farmers, said on Friday that "a negligible portion" of the remaining 2% it imported was from Brazil."As far as the group is able to ascertain, none of the Brazilian chicken it imports was processed through the factories implicated in the scandal," a spokeswoman said."The procurement of locally produced products will always be a priority for Shoprite. However, constant high demand for chicken outstrips supply in South Africa. We therefore have to import very small quantities when needed."However, four shipments due for delivery next month have been placed on hold pending the resolution of the matter.A spokesman for Spar said that although the company's corporate-owned stores did not import any meat from Brazil, it was unclear if that was the case for all of its independently owned shops.David North, Pick n Pay's group executive for strategy and corporate affairs, said all products were subject to strict quality control, including microbial testing."This includes the very small amount of meat we import."According to the World Trade Organisation, 853,000 shipments of products of animal origin from Brazil last year were exported to more than 150 countries.Brazil is one of the world biggest exporters of animal protein.Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries officials at all ports of entry that receive meat have been instructed to test every container of meat from Brazil.Shoprite said it was confident the inspections would ensure that meat that did not comply with South African health and food safety standards would not be released into the country.tshandup@sundaytimes.co.za
