One way to support growth is for tomorrow s trailblazers to spend time with and learn from today s most experienced business leaders people like Barclays Africa CEO Maria Ramos and Tiger Brands CEO Lawrence MacDougall.That is the aim of the Sunday Times Top 100 Companies Leaders on the Move mentorship initiative, sponsored by Johnnie Walker*, a brand that inspires personal progress and recognises that the journey is as important as the destination.On the day of the next event Friday March 31 a small, selected group of budding entrepreneurs will once again travel on a luxury coach around Johannesburg, hosted by well-known broadcasting personality Jeremy Maggs.Along the way, they will spend one power-packed hour at a time with Ramos, MacDougall and one other carefully chosen business leader who will share their business philosophy; the highs and low of their business careers; lessons learnt on the way; and how they ve overcome adversity. This will be followed by a delicious lunch enjoyed with some of Johnnie Walker s exclusive whiskies.At the first event this year, held in February, Maggs spoke to Nando s Southern Africa CEO Geoff Whyte and Nkonki co-founder Sindiswa Zilwa. Lunch was hosted by Alessandro Khojane, the founder of Italian restaurant Gemelli Cucina Bar.At the last Leaders on the Move in 2016, Sandra Griffiths, marketing and innovation director at Diageo SA, which owns the Johnnie Walker brand in South Africa, said the journey to the pinnacle of leadership was often not smooth, requiring tomorrow s leaders to be adept at overcoming adversity.They also need to believe in themselves and their vision, particularly if they re planning an entrepreneurial venture.How to win a seatWant to board the bus?
