Antonio Conte dismisses mind games for Red Devils clashMeanwhile, in an earlier game yesterday, Manchester City cruised into the FA Cup semifinals with a 2-0 victory at Middlesbrough as manager Pep Guardiola showed he is taking the competition seriously.Goals from David Silva and Sergio Ag ero at Riverside Stadium were scant reward for The Citizens as they outclassed The Boro, who must have feared such an outcome when they witnessed the team named by Guardiola.Ominously for Middlesbrough, currently languishing in the relegation zone after failing to win any of their last 10 Premier League matches, all City's world-class players were involved, despite the fact they face Ligue 1 giants AS Monaco in a decisive Champions League last-16 second leg on Wednesday.City's class soon surfaced as three of Guardiola's big guns combined to open the scoring in the third minute.Yaya Tour 's angled pass was headed back across goal by Pablo Zabaleta and any one of three players could have put the ball beyond goalkeeper Brad Guzan, with Silva applying the finishing touch.Remarkably, the opening stages of the second half almost brought a replica of City's goal.This time, Kevin de Bruyne redirected identical Tour 's pass across the goal where Silva was waiting again, but this time he wastefully drove his shot over the bar.City appeared in the mood to finish off Middlesbrough as Guzan was forced to make four fine saves in the space of 10 minutes, twice from Leroy San and also from Silva and Ag ero, who finally found a way past the keeper in the 67th minute when he turned in San 's excellent cross for the second goal.The remaining quarter of the match was all about Guzan as he saved superbly from Silva and Ag ero, while Raheem Sterling had a goal disallowed for offside.When Middlesbrough did create a rare chance for F bio, it was cleared off the line by John Stones.
