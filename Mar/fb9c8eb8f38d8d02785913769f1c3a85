They should be grateful. It's keeping South Africa's test captain afloat in a sea of cricket that offers fewer islands of respite with each passing season."I've taken up surfing as a way to get away from the game," Du Plessis said. "You have to find something on a cricket tour. Just being in your room doesn't get you away from the game, because you're playing shots in your room and worrying about your technique."South Africa's tour of New Zealand, which started when they left home on February 11, is scheduled to end on Wednesday.The Indian Premier League starts on April 5 and will involve Du Plessis among seven of Proteas' key players.In the second week of May, South Africa will reassemble for a tour to England that is scheduled to finish on August 8.Scary stuff, or what?"It's very daunting, and it's going to be a big challenge for me to make sure that even after the Indian Premier League that, mentally, I'm as fresh as I can be and as driven and as motivated to try and be at my best every single day for South Africa," Du Plessis said.Batsman JP Duminy has taken the other option and pulled out of this year's Indian Premier League."JP has decided he needs to get some time with family and move away from the game a little bit, and get some time to focus on doing his best for South Africa," Du Plessis said. "We respect that."Had Du Plessis considered doing the same?"I still feel fresh," he said. "I'm actually not too worried about the IPL happening in a week's time."I know that for a week after this I won't have anything to do with cricket, and then the IPL mania will start and it will be busy for a time.</img>JP Duminy has pulled out of this year's IPL event.
