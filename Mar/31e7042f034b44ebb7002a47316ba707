Goals from David Silva and Sergio Ag ero at Riverside Stadium were scant reward for The Citizens as they outclassed The Boro, who must have feared such an outcome when they witnessed the team named by Guardiola.Ominously for Middlesbrough, currently languishing in the relegation zone after failing to win any of their last 10 Premier League matches, all City's world-class players were involved, despite the fact they face AS Monaco in a decisive Champions League last-16 second leg on Wednesday.City's class soon surfaced as three of Guardiola's big guns combined to open the scoring in the third minute. Antonio Conte dismisses mind games for Red Devils clashYaya Tour 's angled pass was headed back across goal by Pablo Zabaleta and any one of three players could have put the ball beyond the goalkeeper Brad Guzan, with Silva applying the finishing touch.It was a goal destined to erode the fragile confidence of a Middlesbrough team that struggled to find an immediate response apart from two dreadful tackles, one that earned a caution for Antonio Barragan and another that should have brought the same punishment for Grant Leadbitter.Leadbitter, whose inevitable booking eventually came at the end of the half, was employed more impressively when Middlesbrough finally troubled City midway through the half. The midfielder's corner was met by Rudy Gestede, whose header was parried by goalkeeper Claudio Bravo before Zabaleta completed the clearance on the line.Gestede was forced off by injury to be replaced by the former City forward Alvaro Negredo.Remarkably, the opening stages of the second half almost brought a replica of City's goal.This time, Kevin de Bruyne redirected identical Tour 's pass across the goal where Silva was waiting again, but this time he wastefully drove his shot over the bar.City appeared in the mood to finish off Middlesbrough as Guzan was forced to make four fine saves in the space of 10 minutes, twice from Leroy Sane and also from Silva and Ag ero, who finally found a way past the keeper in the 67th minute when he turned in Sane's excellent cross for the second goal.The remaining quarter of the match was all about Guzan as he saved superbly from Silva and Ag ero, while Raheem Sterling had a goal disallowed for offside.When Middlesbrough did create a rare chance for Fabio, it was cleared off the line by John Stones.
