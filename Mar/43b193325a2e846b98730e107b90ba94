Paulsen, a self-confessed power tool addict with a background in marketing and sales, couldn't believe his luck when he saw that Builders and the Home Channel were running a competition to find a new TV presenter.He nailed it with his entry video and landed a plum job co-hosting Home Made Easy with gardening guru Tanya Visser and DIY devotee Elle Franco.On the show, the trio share easy how-to guides for all sorts of home improvement, gardening and decorating projects.We chatted to Paulsen to find out more.Have you always been into DIY?I've had an affinity for DIY since a very young age. As a five-year-old, I would disassemble, then reassemble my toys as a personal challenge to understand how they were put together.As I grew older, I learnt about auto-body repair, leather upholstery, audio visual installation, woodwork and carpentry, metal fabrication and welding as well as acrylic and plastic work.Suzelle DIY shares the secret of how to be craftily 'crehative'What's the coolest DIY project you've ever done?It has to be my savvy storage coffee table project. I used four tomato boxes and a couple of screws. Then added some trolley wheels, gorgeous copper and teal blue paint and finally a succulent plant in the centre. Look out for the video which will be available on YouTube soon.The road to becoming a DIY pro is littered with failed projects. What's your most memorable DIY disaster?One of my favourite DIY passions is working on my classic cars. However, I nearly set my classic 1969 sports coupe on fire trying to refurbish the carburettor luckily the fire extinguisher was nearby!What three essentials does every DIY enthusiast need in their toolkit?This is really tough because I believe if you don't have the right tools, don't do the job. But if I had to choose a DIY survival toolkit it would be a cordless drill and drill-bits (life-saver), a jig saw (for cutting any shape) and a set-square (for measuring and straight lines).What's the best piece of DIY advice you've ever been given?If you fail to prepare, you prepare to fail, so measure twice, and cut once.What's the one thing you think most DIYers do wrong?Whether you're a novice or an expert, if you don't plan adequately you'll run into plenty of headaches. I recommend having a SYSTEM to Save You Stress Time Energy and Money.WATCH the trailer for Home Made Easy Catch 'Home Made Easy' on the Home Channel (DStv channel 176) at 8.00pm on Wednesdays.
