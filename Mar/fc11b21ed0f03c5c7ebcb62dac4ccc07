With their strife-torn squad obliterated in all three matches at the start of the campaign in the UAE last September, Carlos Brathwaite's team has the opportunity to make a statement at home against a Pakistan side that has also been inactive as a national unit since those comprehensive triumphs in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.However, a cloud hangs over the visitors in the aftermath of a corruption scandal that emerged during last month's Pakistan Super League with five players, including internationals Sharjeel Khan and Mohammad Irfan, prevented from leaving their homeland as investigations continue into spot-fixing allegations.Their absence presents a chance, either for players emerging from a period in the wilderness, like opening batsman Ahmed Shehzad and veteran all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez, or newcomers like Shadab Khan and Fakhar Zaman to stake their claims to regular international duty.Today's match is the first of four a rarity in bilateral Twenty20 International series with the remaining three at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad at the end of the week.Yet, for all the hype generated by cricket's most abbreviated and lucrative format, it is fair to suggest that both teams will have a greater level of focus and intensity in the three-match one-day international series that follows in Guyana, especially with the West Indies desperate to stay in the hunt for an automatic qualifying spot for the 2019 World Cup in England.Trounced 3-0 at home by the English just two weeks ago, the two-time former World Cup winners continue to languish in ninth spot in the rankings on 84 points, five behind the Pakistanis.Pakistan have already pipped the West Indies for the last available spot at June's Champions Trophy in England, and although they will still have the chance to get to the World Cup via the qualifying event, failing to qualify as one of the top eight teams will be seen as another embarrassment for the one-time undisputed kings of the game.In what is believed will be his final series before bowing out of the international game, Misbah ul Haq will then lead Pakistan in three tests at the end of the ODIs.
