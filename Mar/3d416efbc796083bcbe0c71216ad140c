Starting with high art, the National Gallery in London is about to display a statue of Christ entirely naked, with all parts intact carved by Michelangelo.The statue is believed to be an earlier version of his The Risen Christ, which stands in the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome.That masterpiece completed in 1521, when he was 46 is not dissimilar to his extremely chiselled and anatomically correct David, though it is perhaps more startling since it shows a proud and muscular Christ, with post-Crucifixion wounds in his side and leaning on the cross, in the nude. Floating gyms, museum workouts: holidays for fitness fanatics are a hot trendThe Guardian's art critic Jonathan Jones explains that such detailed depictions were not uncommon during the Renaissance, when full nudity was understood to be symbolic of Christ's "full humanity, his incarnation on Earth".But as times changed and mankind became more conservative, after Michelangelo's death the starkers statue was given a fig leaf of sorts, a baroque metal veil to cover the bits the great artist had carved. This modest addition is still in place to this day.As for the other version, art historians say Michelangelo had almost finished chiselling out a huge block of marble for the commissioned work when he discovered it had a flaw a dark mark in the stone running like a scar across Christ's face.So he abandoned it and got a new block of marble, from which he chiselled the masterpiece now standing in the church in Rome.Meanwhile, that first attempt was forgotten, then reworked the head, face and most of the cross were added later by unknown artists and ended up in the San Vincenzo Monastery in Bassano Romano.It was only in 1997 that Michelangelo's hand in the work was recognised.Now that version is set to go on display in London in all its glory, on loan for the Michelangelo and Sebastiano exhibition. It runs from March 15 until July 25, and examines the relationship between Michelangelo and his prot g Sebastiano del Piombo.Despite our own prudish misgivings that may yet survive, Jones argues that Michelangelo would never have intended for the statue to offend. Rather, he says, the figure "displays the heroic dignity and strength of a classical hero".It shows Christ risen from the dead, and His body, wounds and all, "now stands triumphantly alive before us".That's a proud notion that, at the very least, a growing group of whacky Australians appear to embrace.

My friends and I started to take some photos with great scenic backgrounds and our bare bums, and I thought I should start a page for all these photos of our travels.""It just snowballed from there and has now become a huge craze."The account is now about body positivity and invites e-mail submissions from men and women who wish to be featured, with a note adding, "We have 50:50 male to female ratio and feature bodies of all shapes and sizes".

This is just a bit of fun in a very family-oriented place."He added that last month only two women had taken up the offer and one of them had "asked her husband's permission" to do so.Allegedly, since the story has been gaining traction on social media, the manager also said they'd received about 20 phone calls from people wanting to confirm that the offer was still running."Nudity is normal," he said. "We see it on the television all the time."
