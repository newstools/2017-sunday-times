Whether it's in suburbia, townships or rural areas, children don't have enough safe spaces to run, play and socialise with other kids.Environmental science experts and children's rights advocates have accused local government entities of not providing sufficient green spaces where youngsters can safely frolic.While major cities say providing safe play spaces for children is on their list of priorities, some admit that vandalism, the costly maintenance of playground equipment and the apartheid legacy all contribute to a lack of such green areas. How the Grim Reaper cuts down SA victims A report by North-West University's environmental science unit, which examined the planning of green, child-friendly spaces, shows that such areas are "a scarce commodity".Such spaces were seen as a luxury by municipalities, said the researchers, and competed for funding with other priorities such as the provision of housing and basic services.The study focused on Vaalhaarts - a rural community bordering the provinces of Northern Cape and the North West - which has been struggling with children's recreation.As many as 20 children drown each year in a local canal because of the lack of child-friendly spaces. The problem is being addressed through a proposed water park.With only 29% of South African children having access to safe play areas, according to UN children's fund Unicef, advocacy group Play Africa believes the country is facing a "play crisis"."In every community across our country, we lack spaces that provide safe, child-friendly spaces for play, imagination, exploration and discovery," said Gretchen Wilson Prangley, head of Play Africa."Across the country, there are very few accessible and safe public spaces where children can just be children."Some people think play is a 'nice-to-have', or something that's a relief from serious learning. But for children, play is actually serious business. The reality is that play helps children grow. Play helps them learn who they are, how to work with others, solve problems."The North-West University report said the Institute for Policy Studies - a US think-tank that looked at children's independent mobility in 16 countries - found that South Africa ranked among the worst.Researchers said this might relate to an unsafe environment and the lack of child-friendly spaces, which had to compete for funding.Unrelated to the study, it was reported last year that the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality needed more than R100-million to replace or repair playground equipment.In response to the growing need for safe spaces, Unicef, with the National Association of Child Care Workers, has started "Safe Parks" for disadvantaged children at 300 sites in South Africa, "to expand children's access to safe, outdoor play opportunities"."Many children in South Africa feel unsafe in their communities and one in four caregivers are reluctant to allow their children to walk to and from school, or play outside, because of fear of crime," said Unicef child protection specialist Anthony Nolan.</img>A park in Umbilo, Durban, has become a dumping ground or vagrants' refuge.

Environmental science expert Zhan Goosen said: "The biggest stumbling block in the provision of child-friendly green space planning is the financial aspect of developing and maintaining these spaces."Oscar van Heerden, of Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo, admitted that the city "did not cater efficiently for child-friendly spaces" and that "our apartheid spatial morphology of many decades in the city is still under redress, and the gap between north and south is very large still".The City of Tshwane said it had in place park development projects "to address the backlog of park infrastructure" in disadvantaged communities.The cities of Cape Town, Durban and Port Elizabeth said they had allocated funds in their capital budgets to develop and upgrade parks.govendersu@sundaytimes.co.za
