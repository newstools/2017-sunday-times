Injuries have decimated the squad, yet before this weekend's sixth round of the HSBC World Sevens Series in Vancouver, the Blitzboks find themselves 24 points clear of Fiji at the top of the standings.They have won four of five tournaments - in Dubai, Wellington, Sydney and Las Vegas, earned 107 out of a possible 110 log points, and won 28 of 30 matches during the campaign. More Super Rugby depression as Sanzaar meetsIt's almost impossible not to win the overall title for the first time since 2009 from here. After four years of finishing runners-up to New Zealand (twice) and Fiji (twice), the title is in their grasp.What has changed for the Blitzboks in 2017?Last season, they made four finals but won only one for a 25% success ratio. This year, they have an 80% success rate in the main game."Maturity is the biggest reason the team has taken a step up this year," says Brown, who suffered knee ligament damage in round two in Cape Town."Coach Neil Powell and conditioning coach Allen [Temple-Jones] often take a lot of responsibility for the mental state of the players during the tournaments."But this season they made a conscious effort to stand back and let the players take control themselves."You would think that's a fairly intuitive thing to do, but it isn't because it's actually quite difficult."There are six games in two days and players have to be 'up' for every one of them. So sometimes the coach, and the captain, won't leave that to chance. They work hard to get the players into the right mental space."I was concerned in Dubai when this new trend started, when the coach said to us that we'd all be responsible for mentally preparing ourselves before each game."Any other time, it might not have worked but the level of maturity the squad has reached means the players could cope."Part of that process has been empowering the players with the tools to take control of their mental focus and respected sports psychologist Pieter Kruger has done a lot of work with the squad over months at the Stellenbosch base camp. Debate rages on overseas based player policy Powell has also shown maturity and the ability to adapt, especially in the face of a mounting injury list and the loss of two key players - current Sevenes world player of the year Seabelo Senatla and hooker Kwagga Smith - to Super Rugby for the remainder of the season."Last week in Las Vegas, you could see the coach putting players in the deep end - Shakes [Siviwe Soyizwapi], Ruhan [Nel] and Dylan Sage started all six games," Brown says. "The coach had the likes of Cecil Afrika and Werner Kok available to start, but he empowered the youngsters."It's a heck of a thing putting so much faith in those players to start every game, but those three took their chance with both hands."That type of empowerment goes hand in hand with the mental approach where every player has to take care of that himself. On game day, it comes down to what kind of mental space the team is in, and I can tell you from chatting to them several times a week, they are a happy squad off the field."sports@timesmedia.co.za
