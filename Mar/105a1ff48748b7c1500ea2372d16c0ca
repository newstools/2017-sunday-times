For that price, US travelers can book four nights at a five-star hotel in Bangkok or Istanbul. Travelers willing to lower their standard of luxury to the four-star level, meanwhile, open up their options to 30 cities, including Las Vegas, Beijing, Berlin, Madrid, Phuket, Prague, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Dubai and Melbourne. It's worth noting, however, that the star system can be a rather arbitrary one, as each country sets its own standard. That means that travelers should be wary of holding all hotels to the standards they may be used to back home. To avoid disappointment and surprise, experts at Hotels.com recommend reading guest reviews to get a better idea of what you'll be paying for. Likewise, if value is more important than location, consider looking for a five-star hotel further afield from major city centers. Experts at Hotels.com also point out that hotels with guest ratings that are higher than their star ratings are likely to be trusted as a super value stay.
