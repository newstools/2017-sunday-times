Tuning the Vine is an innovative inner city wine route that brings the cellars to the Cape Town.Since launching in October 2015, it's become a staple on Cape Town s nightlife calendar, with winemakers and wine lovers spilling happily onto the streets on the second Wednesday of each month.The concept is simple: tuners purchase a ticket (advance tickets are cheaper) online, and then swop the ticket on the night for a tasting glass, a map of participating venues, and a wristband that grants you free tastings at more than a dozen venues scattered on and around Bree Street.A barber shop that doubles as a bar, a speakeasy: Joburg's cool new hipster hangout The format is completely different giving producers the opportunity to showcase wines in a fun, informal, urban context, says Shereen Amos, co-creator, Tuning the Vine. Tuners are expanding their worlds, finding out about new producers, tasting new varietals and falling in love with fresh favourites as they move beyond the familiar wine experience. Each month up to 40 producers showcase their wines, with winemakers often on hand to talk enthusiastic tasters through the winemaking process. It s not only about wine, though; also look out for tastings of craft gin and cider at selected venues, such as the charming Gin Bar on Wale Street. Tastings kick off at 5.30pm, and the last drinks are poured three hours later. However, most venues will remain open for dinner, serving wines from the participating wineries by the glass. And if you find a wine you can t live without, the wineries for that month are also loaded onto wine merchant cybercellar.com, allowing tuners to stock up on their favourite tipples after the fact.After the sell-out success of the Cape Town routes, Tuning the Vine has expanded to Johannesburg in March, with an inner-city wine route taking over Fourth Avenue in Parkhurst on selected mid-week dates.
