Olympic bronze medallist Henri Schoeman, who kept with the leaders in the 1.5km swim and 40km cycle legs, went to the front early in the 10km run, but he faded to finish 10th.Spaniard Javier Gomez Noya won in 1hr 52min 31sec, ahead of Briton Thomas Bishop and Frenchman Vincent Luis.Murray, whose weakest leg is the swimming, was 30th out the water and 1min 05sec off the pace.He made up ground on the bike, moving to 11th spot, although he was 1:10 behind the leaders.Murray was the second-fastest runner on the day, clocking 31min 14sec.But when the likes of Gomez Noya go 31:23, it's not going to wipe out the deficit.At the Olympic Games, Schoeman bided his time on the run, picking off tiring competitors ahead of him in the Rio heat to secure third place.But yesterday was almost a complete reversal.He made his move early in the final leg, and when Gomez Noya attacked he was unable to respond. Likewise with Bishop, Luis and fourth-placed Fernando Alarza of Spain, the fastest runner on the day in 31:04.Wian Sullwald, the third SA entrant, crashed in the cycle leg.The next leg of the series is in Gold Coast, Australia, next month.
