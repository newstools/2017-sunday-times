Hendrika Long, the emergency worker who certified her dead, is haunted by how a trail of red mapped the woman's search for help in a terrified community: bloody handprints on door after door."I didn't want to look at her eyes," she said. "It was like they would show what she had seen in her last minutes."That night, the woman from Delft near Cape Town became a statistic: one more life lost to the second-biggest cause of premature death in Gauteng and the Western Cape - "interpersonal violence".Police say crime on the declineThe Medical Research Council has released a study that shows what is killing people prematurely in different age groups across each province.Not surprisingly, according to the Second National Burden of Disease Study, HIV/Aids is the main culprit countrywide. But as you move through the list of killers, each province has its own cross to bear.MRC head Professor Glenda Gray, who presented the findings to parliament this week, calls it "beautiful data" because it gives each province the best idea of what needs to change.Mpumalanga is the only province where road accidents are second to HIV/Aids. In the Eastern Cape and Northern Cape, it is TB; in Limpopo and the Free State, pneumonia and other lower respiratory-tract infections.In KwaZulu-Natal and North West, strokes (and similar conditions) take a heavy toll.Other big killers in the top five across provinces are heart disease and diarrhoea.Victoria Pillay-Van Wyk, who led the research, said it showed each province's most dire needs for intervention.She said that in the violent Western Cape and Gauteng, "other sectors" needed to get involved. Violence can't land on one department alone.Limpopo "needs to focus on improving quality of care in health services and improving water and sanitation to address the large burden from infectious diseases".Death patterns differed, she said , because "cultural variation, the prevalence of alcohol and drug abuse, and gang or syndicate activity" played a role.A 2015 study by fellow MRC researcher Richard Matzopoul us and his team found that about 45 out of 100,000 people were victims of homicide in metro areas. In non-metro areas the rate was about 33 out of 100,000.Said Gray: "In the Western Cape we have to look at gang violence [while] Gauteng, which is our most economically active province, levels of alcohol and criminal activity are high."In Mpumalanga, a contributing factor to road deaths was the state of roads, "especially to Hammanskraal, where the Easter weekend sees a massive influx of travellers for the Church of Zion events".As for Limpopo, Gray asked: "Why is diarrhoea still stalking us in 2017?" There and in Mpumalanga it is the third-biggest cause of premature death, yet it is easily treatable.Across the country stroke is the biggest killer after HIV/Aids and only Limpopo doesn't have it in the top five.According to Professor Pamela Naidoo, head of the Stroke and Heart Foundation of South Africa, hypertension (high blood pressure) is a major culprit for strokes because "it often goes undetected".For Long, be it a stroke, a car crash, murder or heart attack, it is a human life."I have seen families from shacks coming to see what's happened on the highway after someone's knocked down. Then they get there and realise: it is a family member." Traffic takes toll on kids Traffic accidents are the second-biggest cause of death among children aged five to 14, a study by the Medical Research Council has found.Of the deaths recorded in this age group over a period of 15 years, 50% were from HIV/Aids. Then come traffic injuries, responsible for 10.5% of deaths;Pneumonia and other respiratory infections account for just over 4% of all deaths in this age group;The fourth-biggest killer is diarrhoea, followed closely by meningitis/encephalitis;Drowning accounted for just over 3% of deaths, and epilepsy for 2%;Almost 2% of deaths are due to interpersonal violence; andThe ninth and 10th biggest killers of children are TB and asthma. Data shows what works Early mortality statistics are not all doom and gloom - they also show what we're doing right."We can now say for sure that tobacco control has reduced lung cancer, and this is evidence that controls translate into outcomes," said Professor Glenda Gray, head of the Medical Research Council.And while interpersonal violence was still high, it had come down, and this was evidence that the Firearms Control Act was making a difference, she said.Showing the links between control, legislation and outcomes "sheds light on the potential of things like the upcoming sugar tax, as well as salt regulation which has seen hypertension coming down".Also, while HIV and TB were "still significant causes of death, rates are coming down thanks to the right medication being rolled out".Noncommunicable diseases are on the increase due to lifestyle issues and factors like sugar, alcohol and obesity."Data is critical to us because it informs policy," Gray said.
