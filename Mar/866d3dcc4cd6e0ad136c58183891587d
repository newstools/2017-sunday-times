She cautioned against using sleeping pills, because these lowered the feelings of wellbeing."The current findings suggest that a positive change in sleep is linked to better physical and mental wellbeing further down the line," said Tang."It is refreshing to see the healing potential of sleep outside of clinical trial settings, as this goes to show that the benefits of better sleep are accessible to everyone, and not reserved for those with extremely bad sleep requiring intensive treatments."An important next step is to look at the differences between those who demonstrate a positive and negative change in sleep over time, and identify what lifestyle factors and day-to-day activities are conducive to promoting sleep."Research released to mark World Sleep Day this week also showed that insufficient sleep among the UK working population was costing the economy up to 40-billion (R629-billion) a year, which was 1.86% of the country's GDP.The UK loses just over 200,000 working days a year due to lack of sleep among the working population.

Similarly, if you find you're dozing off on the sofa too early in the evening, get up and do a few jobs so that you save your snoozing for bedtime."
