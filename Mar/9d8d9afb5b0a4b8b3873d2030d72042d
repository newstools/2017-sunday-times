Divide the butter into three equal parts. Take about 50g butter from one part and rub into the flour until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Lightly beat the lemon juice, egg yolk and water together, then add to the flour. Stir with the handle of a wooden spoon until the dough comes together. Knead the dough well. 2) Roll the dough out thinly on a lightly floured surface. Grate one part butter over the dough. Sprinkle with a little flour and fold dough into thirds. Refrigerate dough for 30 minutes.3) Roll the dough out again. Grate over the second part of butter, fold into thirds and refrigerate for another 30 minutes. Repeat the process for the last part of butter.4) Roll the dough out again and line the tart plates. The pastry is enough to make [2 to 3] crusts. 5) Fill the crusts with baking beans and bake blind for 5 minutes at 200 C, then reduce heat to 180 C for another 5 minutes. Remove beans and bake for a further 5 minutes.6) To make the filling, combine the sugar and 4 cups (1 litre) of the milk in a saucepan over a moderate heat. Stir until the sugar has dissolved. 7) Mix the flour and the rest of the milk into a smooth slurry and stir into the hot milk. Stir often and bring to a boil. 8) Add the butter and stir until melted. Remove from the heat.9) Whisk the whole eggs and the egg yolks together. Add some of the hot milk mixture to the eggs to raise the temperature and then pour this into the saucepan. Stir quickly to combine.10) Add the brandy or lemon juice. Stir through. 11) Whisk the egg whites to stiff peak stage. Fold into the custard mixture - do not combine completely as the charm of this milk tart is in the white peaks.12) Pour the hot custard into the lined tart plates. Bake for 30 minutes at 180 C.
