The 'Landers scored the only try of the match and extended the Blues' run of losses in the competitive New Zealand conference to seven.After being beaten by the Chiefs and Crusaders at home in the opening two rounds, the Highlanders beefed up their defence and polished their trademark kick-and-chase game for the trip north.While it was not champagne rugby, the improvement in the Highlanders was evident early as the Blues struggled to cope with the high-ball pressure and committed multiple errors which kept them on the defensive for the first 60 minutes.All Blacks centre George Moala mounted a fightback with a 30m solo effort that took the Blues deep into Highlanders territory where they pounded the Highlanders line for most of the final quarter.But it was the handling problems that ultimately ruined their finishing burst when a forward drive on the stroke of full-time ended with the ball lost on the tryline. As the Highlanders celebrated, captain Elliot Dixon noted the extra effort that had gone into their preparation."It was an awesome effort," he said. "We went to the drawing board and thought we needed to step up our game on defence. It was a good improvement for us, but it was a nail-biter."The Highlanders shocked the Blues with their pressure start and were up 10-0 with a Malakai Fekitoa try and a conversion and penalty by Lima Sopoaga before the Blues were able to get on the board with two Ihaia West penalties.The second half was restricted to penalties with the Blues closing to a point at 12-13 before a Highlanders kick eight minutes from time forced the Blues to play for a try.
