For their Spring/Summer 2017 collection, the local label stayed true to their signature punk aesthetic but added a girly twist. Think leather, mesh and metal studs and feminine silhouettes like pleated mini skirts and structured cross-over jackets.The JJ Schoeman show was a celebration of fashion, colour and women. The three opening looks saw plus-size models sassily strutting down the runway what a triumph for model diversity! Backstage, the beauty looks were all about the eyes. Whether washed over the entire lid, or used as an accent on the waterline, the use of bold colour was both refreshing and exciting.The double liner used at the JJ Schoeman and Sun Goddess shows was a cool update on a classic black winged eye, while the use of cyan blue along the waterline added a new dimension. Student, designer and stylish Nabilah Kariem Peck teamed a fresh-off-the-runway Selfi slip dress from Woolworth's Style By SA collection with an on-trend ruffled blouse and ankle boots.
