Can you give us the background of how you established a career as a stylist?It was inspired by literally having nothing growing up.The passion to have the most amazing clothes, get to touch them, see them and feel even if I can't afford them, was fuelled as I grew older and matriculated.R7,500 wigs local celebs fork out for a guaranteed good hair dayIt would take me a whole magazine to explain but basically growing up disadvantaged in so many areas got me where I am. My mind just shifted to clothes and never moved.The fact that growing up we never got to wear the best any time we wanted made me want to wear as many and actually work with them because I felt robbed when I was growing.I used to imagine different kinds of closets and think if I can't have them I have to work with them. It all started in retail, dressing mannequins - now I'm dressing icons like Simphiwe Dana.Who is your favourite designer?Maki Oh. I love how she never forgets where she comes from, regardless of where she is in the world; how she's con-sistently celebrating her African culture through her work and how she's inspired by the black aesthetic. She always uses it to build amazing work that is very elegant, impactful, rises above expectations and pushes boundaries.What is your favourite city?Cape Town, the city that taught me a lot from fighting to making sure that fear never stands in my way to get what I want and deserve. Three beauty products you swear by?My three beauty products would be shea butter, coconut oil and sunscreen. My ideal hair kit would be Cantu Shea Butter Daily Oil Moisturizer (384ml R160), Hask Coconut Oil Nourishing Conditioner (355ml R140) and Design Essentials Almond Avocado Natural Twist &amp; Set Setting Lotion (237ml R210, all available at Clicks).What is your favourite fragrance?Tom Ford Orchid Soleil (50ml R1,595).
