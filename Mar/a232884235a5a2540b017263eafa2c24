It was his first public appearance in almost two years. The ceremony finished with a performance by a choir of almost 50-strong.The arch was commissioned in order to stand as a symbol of Tutu's "prophetic voice in protest and as a humble priest," and a reminder of the importance of democracy. Each of the 14 arches of wood holds a quotation from one of the 14 lines in South Africa's Constitution.Sn hetta: art and cultural architecture specialistThe Oslo- and New York City-based architecture firm Sn hetta is known for their previous work on the Oslo Opera House, the September 11 Memorial Museum Pavilion in New York, and the extension to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
