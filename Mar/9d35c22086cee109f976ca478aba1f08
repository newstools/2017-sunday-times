Q. In a previous issue, you published a letter from Peter Reynolds.He wrote that his wife was refused entry from New Zealand to Australia because she was travelling on her British passport and had an ETA (Electronic Travel Authority) as normal.Her passport reflects that she is a British citizen but that she was not born in the UK.My friend and I are travelling to Sydney shortly. We both have British passports but were born elsewhere. We have always travelled with the ETA with no problem. Was there a new ruling?My friend applied on the Internet and her paper is now called a '601' rather than an ETA. Is that acceptable? - Mrs Van der Heever Travel tips: Do South Africans struggle to get visas for Russia?A. There are two issues at play, British nationality and Australian regulations. It depends on exactly what type of British nationality the traveller has, irrespective of the fact that they have a British passport.There are six different types of British nationality: British citizenship, British overseas territories citizen, British overseas citizen, British subject, British national (overseas) and British protected person. Visit gov.uk for full details.The British are now referred to as citizens, not subjects, while many British subjects were from the old colonies, born outside the UK, for example in Hong Kong.Those subjects may or may not require visas for a number of countries. It is always best to contact the embassy of the country you are visiting for accurate advice depending on what your passport says, what citizenship you hold and where you live.The 601 is a subclass of the ETA, which gives the holder permission to enter Australia for tourism purposes but not to work.Reynolds's advice is that you check the barcode at the bottom of the title page of your passport to see whether it says GBR or GBS. If it says GBR, you should be OK. Do you have a query for our travel expert? Send your question through to travelmag@sundaytimes.co.za
