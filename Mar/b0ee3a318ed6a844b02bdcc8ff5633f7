Last month, a judge in the High Court in Pretoria ruled that a woman who was facilitating surrogacy for prospective parents in Gauteng had no legal right to accept payment because commercial surrogacy was illegal in South Africa. Robynne Friedman, a surrogacy facilitator for the Surrogacy Advisory Group, said that with the legalisation of gay marriage, there was a demand for surrogacy. Sperm saga at heart of battle over baby boy"They do it successfully and raise the babies beautifully. There is also a demand from heterosexual couples because of infertility, which seems to be an epidemic, and a lot of heterosexual moms who have undergone chemotherapy or have a variation of other medical conditions and require the services of a surrogate mother," she said. "Many couples find a family or friend who acts as a surrogate. "Otherwise, there are agencies, not surrogacy agencies but egg-donor agencies, that may pass on contact details of a surrogate mother, but at no fee." Friedman said the recent court ruling reinforced the law that was already in place."Everyone knew they could not charge an introductory fee. In this case the surrogacy facilitator was not charging an introduction fee, but was offering other services that were valuable. But the judge found that the charges for those services were illegal."
