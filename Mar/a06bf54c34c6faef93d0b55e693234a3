This week Peugeot maker PSA agreed to buy loss-making Opel from General Motors, creating Europe's second-biggest car maker behind Volkswagen and sparking speculation of more consolidation.However, some executives said the deal was unlikely to change the industry landscape on its own, with new competitors in Silicon Valley and China and changing consumer habits set to have a much bigger impact.
