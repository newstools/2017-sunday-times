In the application the civil rights organisation AfriForum has asked for all relevant documentation on the budget and cost of this project as well as the minutes of meetings in the provincial legislature.Hendrik Oosthuizen AfriForum s district coordinator for North West said in a statement the erection of a Zuma statue is inappropriate given the high levels of corruption and poverty in the country.Oosthuizen said the R6 million the province wants to spend on the statue could be better spent.It could be used for example to:- buy more than 100 000 bags of tar for the repair of potholes;- appoint about 36 new police officers in North West;- upgrade and maintain infrastructure;- pay a total of 31 new high school teachers for a year.
