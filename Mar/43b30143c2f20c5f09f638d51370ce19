Conte declared the kind of psychological warfare for which Jos Mourinho is notorious had no effect on results as he prepared to pit his wits against his predecessor in the FA Cup four months after humiliating him in the Premier League.Chelsea mocked United's unbeaten run in the league since then in a preview to tomorrow's match on their official website, which read: "It has lifted them all the way from sixth to sixth."Having riled Mourinho by whipping up the crowd towards the end of his side's 4-0 thrashing of United in October, Conte appeared eager to avoid stooping to such brickbats yesterday.

"They have a lot, a number of great players, with great talent and great experience."Conte had earlier tried to play down October's altercation with Mourinho, who accused his opposite number of humiliating him at the final whistle.Revealing the pair had not spoken since, former Juventus and Italy boss Conte said: "I've shown at Chelsea - not only Chelsea, every team that I managed - that I live the game with great passion."Sometimes, I want to share my enthusiasm, my passion with my players, with my staff, also with the fans. I think it's normal."We are not in the same way. For me, the most important thing is to try to win and then think about another celebration."Conte, who has a fully fit squad for tomorrow's quarterfinal, refused to reveal whether John Terry would start what could be his final cup tie at Stamford Bridge.The captain's only starts since September have come in cup matches, including FA Cup wins over Brentford, Peterborough and Wolves.
