It could have been a night to savour for the Eastern Cape franchise but Bosch's brilliance spared the Sharks some serious blushes.If experienced No10 Lionel Cronje's radar didn't fail him with his long-range 79th minute penalty attempt, they would have occupied a special place in history. However, the rugby gods on duty in Durban didn't have time for a fairy-tale.In a time where the Kings know they will be a mere footnote in Super Rugby history this time in 2018, they left an impressionable calling card.With some unexpected verve and intelligence, Deon Davids's team were deserved leaders at half time. Reds give dominant Lions a helping handBoth tries came at the expense of Sharks flyhalf Benhard Janse van Rensburg's inexperience. His 20th minute clearance kick was charged down by eventual try-scorer Ruann Lerm while his inability to dictate play effectively saw Ruan Botha try a basketball pass. Makazole "Drex" Mapimpi made light work of Jean-luc du Preez to score the second try in the 32nd minute.This went against the grain of the physical dominance the Sharks enjoyed, which was apparent through their 27th minute rolling maul try by half-centurion Lourens Adriaanse.The Sharks' hard work was not complemented by smart tactical kicking by Janse van Rensburg, who clearly seemed to be out of his depth at this level. It didn't come as a surprise when he was hauled off in the 47th minute.With an insistence on keeping the ball among the forwards, livewire utility back Bosch was kept out of the game and Cronje made it a point of not kicking when he was stationed at the back.After all, Cronje had a point to prove after not getting a fair crack at the No10 jersey in his time in Durban.For a player who has never quite realised his immense potential, it was his best match since his days as a crackerjack pivot at Queen's College.The balmy night did not sap their energy and they continued to nip at the Sharks, who were also finding it difficult to locate their power game.When they did find a semblance of structure, they still made heavy weather of scoring their second try.Kobus van Wyk was on the end of the move in the 65th minute but it needed some sharp thinking from Michael Claassens with his quickly taken penalty that unhinged the resolute Kings defence.Bosch's latent nerves of steel and his Big Bertha boot came to the fore to rescue the hosts from what could have been an unspeakable embarrassment.
