Every year the hospital treats 10,000 children for trauma, roughly 20% of them for swallowing objects or caustic liquids. These ingestion injuries, involving objects from batteries to condoms, can be fatal.Such accidents are common among toddlers, and researchers, writing in the South African Medical Journal this week, said regulations were needed to prevent them. Pushy parents 'a danger' to the kidsProfessor Sebastian van As, head of the hospital's trauma unit and co-author of the study, said: "There is a range of objects which are dangerous and can kill children. A simple rule is to make sure all objects under 3cm are kept out of reach of kids under three years old."Batteries and magnets can be deadly because of potential currents and attractions which may cause perforation in the walls of intestines and bowels.Childsafe South Africa assistant director Chiedza Mavengere said the objects most commonly swallowed by children aged four to nine were R1 and R2 coins. Boys were most susceptible, she said.Usually the objects pass uneventfully through the bowel, but in some cases they get stuck and surgery under sedation is needed.The researchers said some commercial objects which should be recalled were small (neodymium) magnetic balls, marketed as "executive toys" in the US.Van As, who is president of Childsafe South Africa, said greater awareness among parents and children - combined with legislation against commercial hazards - could reduce ingestion risks.Joan van Niekerk, president of the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, said caregivers would benefit from a greater awareness of how to keep children safe.</img>Dumisile Nala says a study on preventable deaths had found that children crossing a road without supervision and being hit by cars were also a major concern.

Childsafe SA wants: Safety catches on household detergents; Child-proof bottle tops; A limit on the pH of household detergents; A minimum size of 3cm for toddlers' toys; Secure battery compartments; and Risk and first-aid advice on packaging.
